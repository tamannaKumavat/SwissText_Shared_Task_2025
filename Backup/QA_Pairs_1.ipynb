        "# Generation of QA Pairs Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notebook Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook leverages NLP to generate, evaluate, and refine question–answer (QA) pairs from cleantech media and patent documents, with the goal of advancing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for cleantech.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, we employed a series of  NLP techniques and evaluation strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Selection & Preparation:\n",
        "We curated 50–100 relevant paragraphs from cleantech media and patent datasets, ensuring diversity and relevance to key topics..\n",
        "\n",
        "2. QA Pair Generation:\n",
        "Using large language models (LLMs), we generated fact-based QA pairs from the selected paragraphs, ensuring close alignment with the source content.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. QA Pair Classification:\n",
        "QA pairs were classified into categories (e.g., Factual, Comparative) using rule-based and embedding methods based on semantic similarity to predefined prototypes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation:\n",
        "Recognizing that not every generated QA pair would be of equal quality, we then evaluated each pair using LLM-based critique agents. These agents assessed three key criteria:\n",
        "  - Groundedness: How clearly can the question be answered based on the given context?\n",
        "  - Relevance: How useful is the question for developing cleantech NLP applications?\n",
        "  - Standalone Clarity: Does the question make sense independently, without needing extra context?\n",
        "      \n",
        "  For each criterion, the LLM provided both a numerical score (1 to 5) and detailed feedback, which helped us identify and filter out lower-quality QA pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Filtering & Analysis:\n",
        "QA pairs scoring at least 4 out of 5 on all criteria were retained, and the dataset's quality was visualized for further refinement."

At a mere 7 years of age, and just a few years after launching its first vehicle ( the XPeng G3 went on sales in December 2018), XPeng has wrapped up a year of sales totaling almost 100,000. In 2021, XPeng delivered 98,155 smart EVs, a 263% year-over-year increase.', 'In December, 16,000 vehicles were delivered, a 181% year-over-year increase compared to December 2020. There were 41,751 vehicles delivered in Q4 2021, which was a 222% year-over-year increase.', 'Reinforcing how impressive the 98,155 delivery figure for 2021 is, at the end of the year, XPeng reached just 137,953 cumulative deliveries.', 'All the more impressive, XPeng’ s monthly delivery target is 15,000 vehicles, and December was the second month in a row that was surpassed — and that’ s despite the global automotive chip shortage and other supply chain challenges.', 'In the case of the P7, deliveries were up 102%. GS deliveries were up 75%. The P5 was not on the market one year ago, but its sales did increase 134% month over month.', 'XPeng also noted that its broader charging and sales network in China has been growing “ rapidly. ” It had “ 661 branded supercharging stations across 228 cities and 311 physical retail stores in operation across 121 cities as of the end of November 2021. ”', 'All in all, XPeng’ s growth seems to be rolling out as the company hoped and planned, or even better. It’ s quite an uplifting sight to see another pure EV company scaling up production rapidly and achieving great sales success at a young age. Of course, the reference company need not be named, and we need not compare the two or pretend XPeng should exactly follow Tesla’ s ( whoops) path.

In the latest development, Sinopec has lent its financial muscle to the field. The company plans to have the proposed “ Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project ” up and running by 2023, which will add 20,000 tons of annual output to the small but growing supply of sustainable hydrogen in the global economy.', 'In past years, the green hydrogen field has run afoul of the greenwashing matrix. Hydrogen itself is not “ green. ” Hydrogen can serve as a zero emission fuel, whether combusted or used in a fuel cell. However, the primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, and to some extent coal.', 'The “ green ” in green hydrogen has only appeared in recent years, concurrent with the falling cost of wind and solar energy. The availability of low cost renewable energy has made it possible to lower the carbon footprint of electrolyzer systems, which deploy an electrical current to push hydrogen gas out of water.', 'So, now the issue is not so much whether or not green hydrogen is a real thing. The question is to what extent the interest in green hydrogen will pump up the overall demand for hydrogen too quickly, enabling the supply of fossil sourced hydrogen in the global economy to go up instead of down.', 'That brings us to Sinopec, aka China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation, the well-known Bejing-based energy firm. Though best known for its fossil energy interests, Sinopec has been dabbling in biofuels and it looks like sustainable hydrogen is next in line.', 'Sinopec has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to transition out of fossil-sourced hydrogen. The company currently states its hydrogen output at a total of 3.5 million tons annually. Meanwhile, its newly launched “ Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project ” will only produce 20,000 tons annually.', 'That gap could grow instead of shrinking, if Sinopec follows through on a $ 4.6 billion pivot into natural gas and hydrogen. Also, according to the China Hydrogen Energy Alliance, the annual demand for hydrogen in China alone could grow into the range of 60 million tons annually by 2050.', 'Still, at 20,000 tons the new hydrogen project is nothing to sneeze at. It will be among the biggest such facilities in the world when it commences operations in June 2023, if not the biggest.', 'Actually, it could be the very biggest, by far. The firm Air Liquide has a large-scale electrolyzer facility up and running in Canada, but the output barely scrapes 3,300 tons annually ( 8.2 tonnes daily). Shell has an electrolyzer project under way in Germany that will produce 1,300 tons of hydrogen annually. If you know of any other big projects in the works, drop us a note in the comment thread.', 'If Sinopec calls it quits after a single 20,000-ton project, that would be the end of the story. However, the company has put out signals that the new facility is intended to provide a model for others to follow.', 'One signal is the scale of the company’ s commitment to the sustainable hydrogen infrastructure.', '“ As part of the project, Sinopec will build a new photovoltaic power station with an installed capacity of 300MW and annual power generation of 618 million kilowatt-hours, an electrolyzed water hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons, a spherical hydrogen storage tank with hydrogen storage capacity of 210,000 standard cubic meters, and hydrogen transmission pipelines with a capacity of 28,000 standard cubic meters per hour ( including supporting power transmission and transformation facilities), ” the company explains.', 'Another hint is the existence of a buyer. According to Sinopec, its Tahe Refining &amp; Chemical division will use green hydrogen from the new facility to decarbonize its hydrogen production.', 'That brings up an interesting point about green hydrogen, which is that refinery operations account for a leading source of demand for hydrogen. So, all things being equal, green hydrogen would be deployed to enable the continued production of petroleum-based fuels and chemicals.', 'Well, that’ s the way the cookie crumbles. If the Tahe deal comes through, it would follow a broader trend of deploying renewable energy to in tandem with fossil sources. Sinopec, for example, is among the energy firms that use solar panels to power their oil fields. Coal mines and other extractive sites are also increasingly turning to renewables.', 'Sinopec also recently signed an agreement with Jinko Solar to build solar canopies at 18 Sinopec filling stations in China. That is just one of Sinopec’ s growing suite of solarization projects, and therein lies another hint about the company’ s green hydrogen intentions.', 'Last week Jinko put out the word that it has inked a major solar power deal with Sinopec Star, which plans to build “ several industrial-scale solar-powered, emission-free, hydrogen production facilities across China. ”', 'The facilities will “ serve as proof of concept for the cost-competitive production of hydrogen from advanced solar technology, ” Jinko added.', 'Earlier in December, Sinopec President Ma Yongsheng also seemed to mark a sharp pivot in Sinopec’ s plans for growth in the hydrogen economy.', 'In recent years, Sinopec and China have been targeting conventional, fossil-sourced hydrogen as a “ clean ” fuel but, during a conference in Bejing, Ma Yongsheng indicated a shift in emphasis for Sinopec, towards so-called “ blue ” hydrogen as well as green hydrogen.', 'In terms of keeping fossilized carbon sequestered underground where it belongs, “ blue ” hydrogen is a public relations gimmick. It refers to producing hydrogen from fossil sources, in combination with a carbon capture system.', 'The green hydrogen track has more potential to make a planet-saving impact, partly because legacy engineering firms are beginning to fall all over themselves in pursuit of new business in the green hydrogen field.', 'Mitsubishi, for example, has introduced a new gas turbine designed to transition into green hydrogen as supplies become available, and Cummins is scaling up its hydrogen electrolyzer technology with a $ 5 million assist from the US Department of Energy. Not to be outdone, GE has embarked on a pilot project that could eventually convert the 1,100 megawatt Cricket Valley gas power plant in upstate New York to run on green hydrogen.', 'The green hydrogen supply chain is also maturing. One good example is Siemens Gamesa, which has hooked up with the thermoplastics firm Strohm to supply piping for a green hydrogen mashup with offshore wind farms.', 'Photo: Sustainable hydrogen site prepping for construction ( courtesy of Sinopec).', 'Tina specializes in military and corporate sustainability, advanced technology, emerging materials, biofuels, and water and wastewater issues.

At a mere 7 years of age, and just a few years after launching its first vehicle ( the XPeng G3 went on sales in December 2018), XPeng has wrapped up a year of sales totaling almost 100,000. In 2021, XPeng delivered 98,155 smart EVs, a 263% year-over-year increase.', 'In December, 16,000 vehicles were delivered, a 181% year-over-year increase compared to December 2020. There were 41,751 vehicles delivered in Q4 2021, which was a 222% year-over-year increase.', 'Reinforcing how impressive the 98,155 delivery figure for 2021 is, at the end of the year, XPeng reached just 137,953 cumulative deliveries.', 'All the more impressive, XPeng’ s monthly delivery target is 15,000 vehicles, and December was the second month in a row that was surpassed — and that’ s despite the global automotive chip shortage and other supply chain challenges.', 'In the case of the P7, deliveries were up 102%. GS deliveries were up 75%. The P5 was not on the market one year ago, but its sales did increase 134% month over month.', 'XPeng also noted that its broader charging and sales network in China has been growing “ rapidly. ” It had “ 661 branded supercharging stations across 228 cities and 311 physical retail stores in operation across 121 cities as of the end of November 2021. ”', 'All in all, XPeng’ s growth seems to be rolling out as the company hoped and planned, or even better. It’ s quite an uplifting sight to see another pure EV company scaling up production rapidly and achieving great sales success at a young age.

              "1  ['Sinopec has laid plans to build the largest green hydrogen production facility in the world, but interest in fossil-sourced hydrogen continues apace.', 'Skepticism abounds over the green hydrogen field, and yet leading players on the global energy stage seem willing to give it a whirl. In the latest development, Sinopec has lent its financial muscle to the field. The company plans to have the proposed “ Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project ” up and running by 2023, which will add 20,000 tons of annual output to the small but growing supply of sustainable hydrogen in the global economy.', 'In past years, the green hydrogen field has run afoul of the greenwashing matrix. Hydrogen itself is not “ green. ” Hydrogen can serve as a zero emission fuel, whether combusted or used in a fuel cell. However, the primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, and to some extent coal.', 'The “ green ” in green hydrogen has only appeared in recent years, concurrent with the falling cost of wind and solar energy. The availability of low cost renewable energy has made it possible to lower the carbon footprint of electrolyzer systems, which deploy an electrical current to push hydrogen gas out of water.', 'So, now the issue is not so much whether or not green hydrogen is a real thing. The question is to what extent the interest in green hydrogen will pump up the overall demand for hydrogen too quickly, enabling the supply of fossil sourced hydrogen in the global economy to go up instead of down.', 'That brings us to Sinopec, aka China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, the well-known Bejing-based energy firm. Though best known for its fossil energy interests, Sinopec has been dabbling in biofuels and it looks like sustainable hydrogen is next in line.', 'Sinopec has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to transition out of fossil-sourced hydrogen. The company currently states its hydrogen output at a total of 3.5 million tons annually. Meanwhile, its newly launched “ Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project ” will only produce 20,000 tons annually.', 'That gap could grow instead of shrinking, if Sinopec follows through on a $ 4.6 billion pivot into natural gas and hydrogen. Also, according to the China Hydrogen Energy Alliance, the annual demand for hydrogen in China alone could grow into the range of 60 million tons annually by 2050.', 'Still, at 20,000 tons the new hydrogen project is nothing to sneeze at. It will be among the biggest such facilities in the world when it commences operations in June 2023, if not the biggest.', 'Actually, it could be the very biggest, by far. The firm Air Liquide has a large-scale electrolyzer facility up and running in Canada, but the output barely scrapes 3,300 tons annually ( 8.2 tonnes daily). Shell has an electrolyzer project under way in Germany that will produce 1,300 tons of hydrogen annually. If you know of any other big projects in the works, drop us a note in the comment thread.', 'If Sinopec calls it quits after a single 20,000-ton project, that would be the end of the story. However, the company has put out signals that the new facility is intended to provide a model for others to follow.', 'One signal is the scale of the company’ s commitment to the sustainable hydrogen infrastructure.', '“ As part of the project, Sinopec will build a new photovoltaic power station with an installed capacity of 300MW and annual power generation of 618 million kilowatt-hours, an electrolyzed water hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons, a spherical hydrogen storage tank with hydrogen storage capacity of 210,000 standard cubic meters, and hydrogen transmission pipelines with a capacity of 28,000 standard cubic meters per hour ( including supporting power transmission and transformation facilities), ” the company explains.', 'Another hint is the existence of a buyer. According to Sinopec, its Tahe Refining & Chemical division will use green hydrogen from the new facility to decarbonize its hydrogen production.', 'That brings up an interesting point about green hydrogen, which is that refinery operations account for a leading source of demand for hydrogen. So, all things being equal, green hydrogen would be deployed to enable the continued production of petroleum-based fuels and chemicals.', 'Well, that’ s the way the cookie crumbles. If the Tahe deal comes through, it would follow a broader trend of deploying renewable energy to in tandem with fossil sources. Sinopec, for example, is among the energy firms that use solar panels to power their oil fields. Coal mines and other extractive sites are also increasingly turning to renewables.', 'Sinopec also recently signed an agreement with Jinko Solar to build solar canopies at 18 Sinopec filling stations in China. That is just one of Sinopec’ s growing suite of solarization projects, and therein lies another hint about the company’ s green hydrogen intentions.', 'Last week Jinko put out the word that it has inked a major solar power deal with Sinopec Star, which plans to build “ several industrial-scale solar-powered, emission-free, hydrogen production facilities across China. ”', 'The facilities will “ serve as proof of concept for the cost-competitive production of hydrogen from advanced solar technology, ” Jinko added.', 'Earlier in December, Sinopec President Ma Yongsheng also seemed to mark a sharp pivot in Sinopec’ s plans for growth in the hydrogen economy.', 'In recent years, Sinopec and China have been targeting conventional, fossil-sourced hydrogen as a “ clean ” fuel but, during a conference in Bejing, Ma Yongsheng indicated a shift in emphasis for Sinopec, towards so-called “ blue ” hydrogen as well as green hydrogen.', 'In terms of keeping fossilized carbon sequestered underground where it belongs, “ blue ” hydrogen is a public relations gimmick. It refers to producing hydrogen from fossil sources, in combination with a carbon capture system.', 'The green hydrogen track has more potential to make a planet-saving impact, partly because legacy engineering firms are beginning to fall all over themselves in pursuit of new business in the green hydrogen field.', 'Mitsubishi, for example, has introduced a new gas turbine designed to transition into green hydrogen as supplies become available, and Cummins is scaling up its hydrogen electrolyzer technology with a $ 5 million assist from the US Department of Energy. Not to be outdone, GE has embarked on a pilot project that could eventually convert the 1,100 megawatt Cricket Valley gas power plant in upstate New York to run on green hydrogen.', 'The green hydrogen supply chain is also maturing. One good example is Siemens Gamesa, which has hooked up with the thermoplastics firm Strohm to supply piping for a green hydrogen mashup with offshore wind farms.', 'Photo: Sustainable hydrogen site prepping for construction ( courtesy of Sinopec).', 'Tina specializes in military and corporate sustainability, advanced technology, emerging materials, biofuels, and water and wastewater issues.

Their innovation involves using a novel material that can generate electricity on the surfaces of everyday items such as cell phones, cars, and backpacks.', 'This novel light-absorbing material is thin and flexible enough to be applied to the surface of almost any building or everyday object. Using an innovative technique developed at Oxford, which layers multiple light-absorbing materials within a single solar cell, the researchers have captured a broader range of the light spectrum, enabling greater power generation from the same amount of sunlight.', 'This ultra-thin material, utilizing the multi-junction method, has now received independent certification for achieving over 27% energy efficiency. This efficiency matches that of conventional silicon photovoltaics, which typically use single-layer, energy-generating materials.', \"Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ( AIST) granted the certification ahead of the scientific study's publication later this year.\", 'During just five years experimenting with our stacking or multi-junction approach, we have raised power conversion efficiency from around 6% to over 27%, close to the limits of what single-layer photovoltaics can achieve today. We believe that, over time, this approach could enable the photovoltaic devices to achieve far greater efficiencies, exceeding 45%.', 'Dr. Shuaifeng Hu, Post Doctoral Fellow, Physics Department, University of Oxford', 'With an energy efficiency of over 27%, this new material compares favorably with the approximately 22% efficiency of current solar panels, which convert about 22% of sunlight into energy. The versatility of this ultra-thin and flexible material is also crucial. It is nearly 150 times thinner than a silicon wafer at just over one micron thick. Unlike traditional photovoltaics, which are typically applied to silicon panels, this new material can be applied to almost any surface.', 'By using new materials which can be applied as a coating, we have shown we can replicate and out-perform silicon whilst also gaining flexibility. This is important because it promises more solar power without the need for so many silicon-based panels or specially-built solar farms.', 'Dr. Junke Wang, Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions Postdoc Fellow, Physics Department, University of Oxford', 'The researchers believe that this method could make solar energy the most sustainable renewable energy source while continuing to drive down costs. Since 2010, the global average price of solar electricity has decreased by about 90%, making it nearly a third less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels.', 'As new materials like thin-film perovskite reduce the reliance on silicon panels and specialized solar farms, these innovations promise even greater cost savings in the future.', '“ We can envisage perovskite coatings being applied to broader types of surface to generate cheap solar power, such as the roof of cars and buildings and even the backs of mobile phones. If more solar energy can be generated in this way, we can foresee less need in the longer term to use silicon panels or build more and more solar farms, ” Dr. Wang added.', 'Around 30 experts, including the researchers, are working on photovoltaics under the direction of Oxford University Physics Department Professor of Renewable Energy Henry Snaith. Their groundbreaking work in photovoltaics, which has benefited from a customized robotic laboratory, began about ten years ago. They specialize in the application of thin-film perovskite.', '“ The latest innovations in solar materials and techniques demonstrated in our labs could become a platform for a new industry, manufacturing materials to generate solar energy more sustainably and cheaply by using existing buildings, vehicles, and objects, ” Henry Snaith adds.', 'Their work has already begun to find applications in the construction, utilities, and auto manufacturing sectors, demonstrating its strong commercial potential.', \"Oxford PV, a UK company founded in 2010 by Professor Henry Snaith, the Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, to commercialize perovskite photovoltaics, has recently begun large-scale manufacturing of these solar cells at its factory in Brandenburg-an-der-Havel, near Berlin, Germany. This is the world's first “ perovskite-on-silicon ” tandem solar cell production line.\", 'The latest innovations in solar materials and techniques demonstrated in our labs could become a platform for a new industry, manufacturing materials to generate solar energy more sustainably and cheaply by using existing buildings, vehicles, and objects.', '“ Supplying these materials will be a fast-growth new industry in the global green economy, and we have shown that the UK is innovating and leading the way scientifically. However, without new incentives and a better pathway to convert this innovation into manufacturing, the UK will miss the opportunity to lead this new global industry, ” Professor Snaith added.', 'The Thermo Scientific™ MAX-iAQ™ is a fully automated ambient air monitoring solution with 20 detection points, specifically designed for the accurate detection of trace compounds in environments with high humidity.', 'The LInspector Edge In-line Mass Profilometer is a cutting-edge electrode mass loading inspection machine.', 'Discover IGA Ecosorp from Hiden Isochema: a state-of-the-art analyzer for dynamic gas and vapor sorption analysis.', \"AZoCleantech interviews Carbon Limit's Founder and CEO about the company's mission to reduce one billion tons of CO2 with CaptureCrete, an innovative concrete technology.\", \"Giampiero Frisio of ABB discusses AI's impact on data center sustainability and the integration of renewable energy for efficiency.\", 'In this interview, AZoCleantech talks to Trevor Tilman and Kelly McPartland about carbon capture and storage, analysis of CO2 purity and more.', \"Hi, I 'm Azthena, you can trust me to find commercial scientific answers from AZoNetwork.com.\", 'A few things you need to know before we start.

On May 13, company representatives and partners including the Japanese government celebrated the official opening of a new hydrogen pilot plant in Kawasaki, Japan. Operation start of this commercial-scale facility was in March 2024. The trial operation of four 0.8 MW modules is another milestone towards the realization of a commercial multi-module 100 MW-class alkaline water electrolysis system for green hydrogen production.', 'The hydrogen market is going to expand rapidly in the coming years. According to the Hydrogen Council, cumulative global installed capacity of water electrolyzers forecasted to reach approximately 300 GW by 2030. To meet this increasing demand, Asahi Kasei is currently developing the Aqualyzer™ alkaline water electrolyzer optimized for the production of green hydrogen.', 'In order to test this new system under realistic conditions in a multi-module setup, the company started constructing a pilot plant at its manufacturing site in Kawasaki in November 2022. The new facility started operation in March 2024, and on May 13, company representatives and partners gathered in Kawasaki to celebrate its official opening.', 'Masami Takenaka, Lead Executive Officer at Asahi Kasei and responsible for the company’ s hydrogen business, said, “ This pilot facility is milestone not only for Asahi Kasei, but also for the global hydrogen business in general. We believe that successfully operating our equipment in this test facility will be a door opener for commercial large-scale multi-module alkaline water electrolyzers and eventually the realization of a hydrogen society ”.', 'For the production of green hydrogen, electrolysis systems need to respond to fluctuating power supply from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar. In the pilot plant, four 0.8 MW Aqualyzer™ modules are being operated under realistic conditions, including operation during maintenance and low power supply during nighttime. In addition, the equipment is designed to simulate fluctuating power input from solar or wind power. By utilizing the data obtained from these trials, Asahi Kasei will further optimize the equipment design, operation methods, and control technology of the electrolysis system. With its multi-module approach, Asahi Kasei aims to combine up to ten modules with a capacity of 10 MW each, enabling commercial large-scale electrolysis systems with a capacity of up to 100 MW.', 'Asahi Kasei’ s hydrogen business is based on more than four decades of large-scale and long-term experience in the field of chlor-alkali electrolysis. Aiming for a total sales volume of ¥100 billion ( €600 million) by 2030, the company plans to start commercial business activities for its alkaline water electrolyzers in 2025.', 'The pilot plant in Kawasaki is an important step toward achieving this goal, after the successful long-term tests of its 10 MW single-stack alkaline-water electrolysis system at the Fukushima Energy Research Field ( FH2R) 1 in Namie, Fukushima, Japan, since 2020. The practical experience gained in Namie and the trial operation at the pilot plant in Kawasaki will further underpin Asahi Kasei’ s market entry with large-scale and highly reliable multi-module alkaline water electrolysis equipment. This experience will also be leveraged for the joint feasibility study with Gentari and JGC for a 60 MW-class electrolyzer in Malaysia targeted for 2027, as announced in November 2023.', 'Construction and operation of the pilot plant is supported by the “ Green Innovation Fund2 ” of Japan’ s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization ( NEDO).', 'This product profile summarizes the MAX-iR FTIR Gas Analyzer from Thermo Fisher Scientific.', 'The FT4 Powder Rheometer is a universal powder flow tester for measuring powder flow properties and powder behavior.', 'The TriStar III Plus is a high throughput surface area and porosity analzyer.', \"Laurence Molke, CEO of CycleØ, discusses the company's role in sustainable biomethane production and advancing decarbonization efforts.\", \"In this interview, Ieda Gomes Yell discusses the Isle of Man's Innovation Challenge and how it is fostering cleantech, AI, and FinTech solutions for sustainability and net-zero goals.\", \"This interview explores the intersection of policy, innovation, and commercialization within the UK's cleantech sector, with a focus on the initiatives and strategies being pursued by Cleantech for UK under Sarah Mackintosh's leadership.\", \"Hi, I 'm Azthena, you can trust me to find commercial scientific answers from AZoNetwork.com.\", 'A few things you need to know before we start.

Credit: outdoorsman/Shutterstock.com', 'The authors indicate that if temperatures rise by more than 2.1 degrees Celsius, the ice-free period in most of Hudson Bay may exceed the maximum fasting time that adult polar bears can tolerate.', 'Hudson Bay, located in the Arctic Ocean off the coast of northern Canada, is covered in sea ice during the season and is home to roughly 1,700 polar bears. Polar bears spend the winter on the sea ice, hunting seals, their preferred prey. When the ice melts in the spring, they come ashore and fast during the ice-free summer before returning to the sea ice in the melts.', 'Over the last three decades, the Hudson Bay area has warmed by more than one degree Celsius, extending the ice-free period from around 120 to 150 days. Polar bears in the bay rely on sea ice to hunt. Therefore, an extending ice-free period could affect both their survival rate during the fasting period and their reproductive success during the following hunting season.', \"In the western and southern Hudson Bay regions, where losses in polar bear populations have already been noted, Julienne Stroeve and colleagues estimated projected changes to the ice-free time by analyzing predictions from the IPCC's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 ( CMIP6) models. It is believed that polar bears could comfortably endure 183–218 days of ice-free time.\", 'The authors calculated that if global warming surpasses 2.1 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius, respectively, the ice-free period might last longer than the 183-day limit in the western and southern Hudson Bay regions.', \"Furthermore, they predict that seasonal ice melt will probably happen sooner in the spring. Since cubs are usually born between November and January, this might decrease the bears ' nursing time, which could lower their reproductive success.\", 'The scientists emphasize that if global warming is kept to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, the Hudson Bay polar bear population has a strong chance of survival.', 'Stroeve, J., et al.

battery components directly, reducing waste and reliance on foreign materials.', 'To ensure a successful transition to clean energy in the US, the production of electric vehicle ( EV) batteries must be significantly expanded. However, the US depends heavily on other countries for the materials required for these batteries, making it vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.', \"Argonne, Toyota Research Institute of North America, and Toyota's Battery Lifecycle Solutions group are investigating novel approaches to recycling battery components. If successful, this endeavor could strengthen and improve the circularity of domestic battery supply chains, allowing the United States to deploy EVs quickly.\", 'Most battery recycling involves chemically disassembling end-of-life battery components to produce the raw materials needed for manufacture. In contrast to this conventional method, a process known as direct recycling carefully separates the constituent parts of spent batteries. Manufacturers can reuse the components if they preserve their original structure effectively.', \"Batteries ' positive electrodes, or cathodes, have intricate chemical compositions. Their manufacturing procedures are, therefore, expensive and wasteful.\", 'Direct recycling can effectively minimize waste and manufacturing expenses by preserving the cathodes from batteries nearing their end of life. It may also reduce the requirement for pure raw materials.', 'Direct recycling is cutting-edge in the battery industry, there are a few startup companies with small-scale pilot projects underway. But implementation at commercial scale is still in need of innovations.', 'Argonne and Toyota Motor North America have signed a cooperative research and development agreement to create a direct recycling method for the cathodes in lithium-ion batteries, which are common in electric vehicles. The group focuses on cobalt, manganese, and nickel cathodes.', \"The partnership uses a successful, patent-pending direct recycling method created by the ReCell Center in Argonne. Batteries ' cathodes and anodes, or negative electrodes, are separated using a magnet.\", 'Toyota is supplying Argonne with both end-of-life and new plug-in hybrid EV batteries.', 'Besides recycling end-of-life batteries, we are also interested in recycling new batteries, manufacturers produce some battery cells that fail quality testing. We can potentially demonstrate that manufacturers can take cathodes out of failed cells and put them back into their production process. This capability could translate into huge cost savings.', \"At Argonne’ s Materials Engineering Research Facility ( MERF), researchers will use ReCell’ s direct recycling process on Toyota’ s battery cells to extract and regenerate the cathode material. Using coin cells, the team will evaluate different facets of the cathodes ' performance, such as capacity, lifespan, and impedance ( a form of resistance to electric current).\", \"Researchers at MERF plan to increase the recycling process if the cells function well. Then, using the extracted cathodes, Argonne's Cell Analysis, Modeling, and Prototyping Facility will construct larger pouch cells and evaluate the functionality of the cells. At the same time, Toyota will construct and test cells at its research facilities.\", 'The team will assess the performance of the recycled cathodes against that of new, pristine cathodes. They will also utilize Argonne’ s EverBatt model to analyze the costs and environmental impacts of implementing the direct recycling process for Toyota’ s batteries.', 'Albert Lipson concludes, “ Our goal is to prove that the process can make high-performing cathodes cost-effectively while reducing energy use and emissions, if we are successful, EV and battery manufacturers can potentially commercialize the process. ”', 'The research project is a component of the ReCell Center, which receives support from the DOE’ s Vehicle Technologies Office.', 'This product profile summarizes the MAX-iR FTIR Gas Analyzer from Thermo Fisher Scientific.', 'The FT4 Powder Rheometer is a universal powder flow tester for measuring powder flow properties and powder behavior.', 'The GeoPyc 1365 measured the envelope density of formed pieces without the use of hazardous materials.', \"Laurence Molke, CEO of CycleØ, discusses the company's role in sustainable biomethane production and advancing decarbonization efforts.\", \"In this interview, Ieda Gomes Yell discusses the Isle of Man's Innovation Challenge and how it is fostering cleantech, AI, and FinTech solutions for sustainability and net-zero goals.\", \"This interview explores the intersection of policy, innovation, and commercialization within the UK's cleantech sector, with a focus on the initiatives and strategies being pursued by Cleantech for UK under Sarah Mackintosh's leadership.\", \"Hi, I 'm Azthena, you can trust me to find commercial scientific answers from AZoNetwork.com.\", 'A few things you need to know before we start.

Using an innovative technique developed at Oxford, which layers multiple light-absorbing materials within a single solar cell, the researchers have captured a broader range of the light spectrum, enabling greater power generation from the same amount of sunlight.', 'This ultra-thin material, utilizing the multi-junction method, has now received independent certification for achieving over 27% energy efficiency. This efficiency matches that of conventional silicon photovoltaics, which typically use single-layer, energy-generating materials.', \"Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ( AIST) granted the certification ahead of the scientific study's publication later this year.\", 'During just five years experimenting with our stacking or multi-junction approach, we have raised power conversion efficiency from around 6% to over 27%, close to the limits of what single-layer photovoltaics can achieve today. We believe that, over time, this approach could enable the photovoltaic devices to achieve far greater efficiencies, exceeding 45%.', 'Dr. Shuaifeng Hu, Post Doctoral Fellow, Physics Department, University of Oxford', 'With an energy efficiency of over 27%, this new material compares favorably with the approximately 22% efficiency of current solar panels, which convert about 22% of sunlight into energy. The versatility of this ultra-thin and flexible material is also crucial. It is nearly 150 times thinner than a silicon wafer at just over one micron thick. Unlike traditional photovoltaics, which are typically applied to silicon panels, this new material can be applied to almost any surface.', 'By using new materials which can be applied as a coating, we have shown we can replicate and out-perform silicon whilst also gaining flexibility. This is important because it promises more solar power without the need for so many silicon-based panels or specially-built solar farms.', 'Dr. Junke Wang, Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions Postdoc Fellow, Physics Department, University of Oxford', 'The researchers believe that this method could make solar energy the most sustainable renewable energy source while continuing to drive down costs. Since 2010, the global average price of solar electricity has decreased by about 90%, making it nearly a third less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels.', 'As new materials like thin-film perovskite reduce the reliance on silicon panels and specialized solar farms, these innovations promise even greater cost savings in the future.', '“ We can envisage perovskite coatings being applied to broader types of surface to generate cheap solar power, such as the roof of cars and buildings and even the backs of mobile phones. If more solar energy can be generated in this way, we can foresee less need in the longer term to use silicon panels or build more and more solar farms, ” Dr. Wang added.', 'Around 30 experts, including the researchers, are working on photovoltaics under the direction of Oxford University Physics Department Professor of Renewable Energy Henry Snaith. Their groundbreaking work in photovoltaics, which has benefited from a customized robotic laboratory, began about ten years ago. They specialize in the application of thin-film perovskite.', '“ The latest innovations in solar materials and techniques demonstrated in our labs could become a platform for a new industry, manufacturing materials to generate solar energy more sustainably and cheaply by using existing buildings, vehicles, and objects, ” Henry Snaith adds.', 'Their work has already begun to find applications in the construction, utilities, and auto manufacturing sectors, demonstrating its strong commercial potential.', \"Oxford PV, a UK company founded in 2010 by Professor Henry Snaith, the Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, to commercialize perovskite photovoltaics, has recently begun large-scale manufacturing of these solar cells at its factory in Brandenburg-an-der-Havel, near Berlin, Germany. This is the world's first “ perovskite-on-silicon ” tandem solar cell production line.\", 'The latest innovations in solar materials and techniques demonstrated in our labs could become a platform for a new industry, manufacturing materials to generate solar energy more sustainably and cheaply by using existing buildings, vehicles, and objects.', '“ Supplying these materials will be a fast-growth new industry in the global green economy, and we have shown that the UK is innovating and leading the way scientifically. However, without new incentives and a better pathway to convert this innovation into manufacturing, the UK will miss the opportunity to lead this new global industry, ” Professor Snaith added.', 'The Thermo Scientific™ MAX-iAQ™ is a fully automated ambient air monitoring solution with 20 detection points, specifically designed for the accurate detection of trace compounds in environments with high humidity.', 'The LInspector Edge In-line Mass Profilometer is a cutting-edge electrode mass loading inspection machine.', 'Discover IGA Ecosorp from Hiden Isochema: a state-of-the-art analyzer for dynamic gas and vapor sorption analysis.', \"AZoCleantech interviews Carbon Limit's Founder and CEO about the company's mission to reduce one billion tons of CO2 with CaptureCrete, an innovative concrete technology.\", \"Giampiero Frisio of ABB discusses AI's impact on data center sustainability and the integration of renewable energy for efficiency.\", 'In this interview, AZoCleantech talks to Trevor Tilman and Kelly McPartland about carbon capture and storage, analysis of CO2 purity and more.', \"Hi, I 'm Azthena, you can trust me to find commercial scientific answers from AZoNetwork.com.\", 'A few things you need to know before we start.

        "\n",

        "        It is easily interpretable since we can trace the category decision to keyword matches. However, it is limited flexibility if questions use synonyms or varied phrasing that is not in the keyword list.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - BERT Sentence Approach:\n",
        "    In this approach, we use a SentenceTransformer model to encode each generated question into an embedding vector. We then compare these embeddings to precomputed embeddings of category prototype texts (i.e., descriptions of what each category should capture) using cosine similarity. The category with the highest similarity score is assigned to the question.\n",
        "    In this approach, Tthe quality of classification heavily depends on the choice of the prototype texts and the underlying model.\n",
        "    We have evaluated both methods and found that the BERT sentence approach outperformed the rule-based method. For patent questions, we even experimented with replacing the  [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model with the [AI-Growth-Lab/PatentSBERTa](https://github.com/AI-Growth-Lab/PatentSBERTa) model, which gave even better results in capturing nuanced technical details.\n",

        "After running our QA pairs through the LLM-based critique agents, we now have scores for each question on three key criteria: groundedness, relevance, and standalone clarity. In this step, we filter out the QA pairs that score below our threshold in any of these criteria. The following code displays the evaluation metrics before filtering and then retains only those questions that score at least 3 on each criterion.\n",

After applying our filtering criteria—removing any pair that scored below 3 in groundedness, relevance, or standalone clarity—only 86 QA pairs remained. This significant reduction indicates that many generated QA pairs did not meet our quality standards. Such a high attrition rate may be due to the limitations of the generation process, where some questions might be ambiguous, not contextually grounded, or overly dependent on the source text. It could also reflect the sensitivity of our evaluation prompts and the complexity of the cleantech domain, particularly in technical patent contexts.\n",

By using only the top-performing QA pairs, we significantly reduce noise in our dataset, thereby establishing a robust foundation for subsequent stages of our RAG system. Ultimately, while the filtering process discards a large portion of the initially generated pairs, it enhances the overall quality, making our downstream tasks more efficient and effective."

        "From the set of five questions below, we observe several key characteristics that demonstrate the quality and diversity of the generated QA pairs. Overall, these examples illustrate that our process successfully produced questions that are contextually grounded, relevant, and thought-provoking:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The questions address both technical and real-world concerns—for example, one question explores the potential for recycling electric car batteries and its broader environmental and economic benefits, while another discusses the impact of global warming on wildlife. This shows that our QA pairs capture a range of topics within the cleantech domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - They integrate multiple aspects of the domain. Questions connect technological aspects (like recycling challenges and grid stability with V2X technology) with behavioral or market trends (such as the influence of owning an electric vehicle on solar panel installations). This blend of technical and contextual elements makes the QA pairs more comprehensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The questions are formulated to invite detailed and informative answers. By asking about challenges and potential solutions in one case or the broader implications of a technology in another, these questions encourage responses that are both analytical and forward-looking.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In general, the generated questions are clear and self-contained, meaning they can stand alone without needing extensive external context. This quality is crucial for ensuring that the QA pairs are useful in downstream tasks, like feeding into a retrieval-augmented generation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the diversity and clarity of these questions from technical specifics to broader market and environmental implications demonstrate that our QA pair generation method is effective at producing high-quality, varied, and contextually rich questions across different aspects of cleantech innovation.\n",

        "\n",
        "In addition to our generated QA pairs, we evalutate the human evaluation dataset(cleantech_rag_evaluation_data_2024-09-20.csv). This dataset is a small, high-quality evaluation set designed to benchmark the retrieval step in the RAG system. The human evaluators have already curated these 28 examples for quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "We pass this dataset through our classification and evaluation pipeline to see how well our automated QA evaluation compares. After running the examples through the pipeline (which includes our LLM-based critique agents and filtering logic), we found that only 2 out of the 28 examples were classified as good.\n",
        "\n",
        "This outcome highlights a few key insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - High Standards for Quality:\n",
        "  Our pipeline uses strict evaluation metrics for groundedness, relevance, and standalone clarity. The fact that only 2 examples met our threshold indicates that these metrics are effective at distinguishing high quality QA pairs from those that are ambiguous, irrelevant, or overly context dependent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Differences in Human vs. Automated Judgment:\n",
        "  Although the human evaluation dataset is curated for quality, our automated critique agents may apply slightly different standards. This gap can arise due to the inherent differences between human judgment and the deterministic nature of our LLM-based scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Potential Areas for Improvement:\n",
        "  The low pass rate (2/28) suggests that even the high-quality human-curated examples can sometimes fall short of our strict automatic evaluation criteria. This may be due to subtle issues in the questions or context that our models pick up on. It also indicates that our QA generation and evaluation techniques could be further fine-tuned to align better with human judgments.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Implications for the Retrieval Step:\n",
        "  Since this evaluation dataset is specifically for assessing the Retrieval component of our RAG system, maintaining a high-quality benchmark is crucial. Even though our automated pipeline filters aggressively, ensuring that the retrieval component consistently returns the top-quality examples is a key factor in the overall system performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, processing the human evaluation dataset demonstrates the robustness of our filtering and quality control process, while also revealing areas where our automated system might differ from human expectations. This insight is valuable for tuning both our QA generation methods and our evaluation criteria to create an optimal RAG system.\n"
