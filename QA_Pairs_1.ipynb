        "# Generation of QA Pairs Notebook\n",

        "## Notebook Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook leverages NLP to generate, evaluate, and refine question–answer (QA) pairs from cleantech media and patent documents, with the goal of advancing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for cleantech.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, we employed a series of  NLP techniques and evaluation strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Selection & Preparation:\n",
        "We curated 50–100 relevant paragraphs from cleantech media and patent datasets, ensuring diversity and relevance to key topics..\n",
        "\n",
        "2. QA Pair Generation:\n",
        "Using large language models (LLMs), we generated fact-based QA pairs from the selected paragraphs, ensuring close alignment with the source content.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. QA Pair Classification:\n",
        "QA pairs were classified into categories (e.g., Factual, Comparative) using rule-based and embedding methods based on semantic similarity to predefined prototypes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation:\n",
        "Recognizing that not every generated QA pair would be of equal quality, we then evaluated each pair using LLM-based critique agents. These agents assessed three key criteria:\n",
        "  - Groundedness: How clearly can the question be answered based on the given context?\n",
        "  - Relevance: How useful is the question for developing cleantech NLP applications?\n",
        "  - Standalone Clarity: Does the question make sense independently, without needing extra context?\n",
        "      \n",
        "  For each criterion, the LLM provided both a numerical score (1 to 5) and detailed feedback, which helped us identify and filter out lower-quality QA pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Filtering & Analysis:\n",
        "QA pairs scoring at least 4 out of 5 on all criteria were retained, and the dataset's quality was visualized for further refinement."

At a mere 7 years of age, and just a few years after launching its first vehicle ( the XPeng G3 went on sales in December 2018), XPeng has wrapped up a year of sales totaling almost 100,000. In 2021, XPeng delivered 98,155 smart EVs, a 263% year-over-year increase.', 'In December, 16,000 vehicles were delivered, a 181% year-over-year increase compared to December 2020. There were 41,751 vehicles delivered in Q4 2021, which was a 222% year-over-year increase.', 'Reinforcing how impressive the 98,155 delivery figure for 2021 is, at the end of the year, XPeng reached just 137,953 cumulative deliveries.', 'All the more impressive, XPeng’ s monthly delivery target is 15,000 vehicles, and December was the second month in a row that was surpassed — and that’ s despite the global automotive chip shortage and other supply chain challenges.', 'In the case of the P7, deliveries were up 102%.

              "1  ['Sinopec has laid plans to build the largest green hydrogen production facility in the world, but interest in fossil-sourced hydrogen continues apace.', 'Skepticism abounds over the green hydrogen field, and yet leading players on the global energy stage seem willing to give it a whirl. In the latest development, Sinopec has lent its financial muscle to the field. The company plans to have the proposed “ Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project ” up and running by 2023, which will add 20,000 tons of annual output to the small but growing supply of sustainable hydrogen in the global economy.', 'In past years, the green hydrogen field has run afoul of the greenwashing matrix. Hydrogen itself is not “ green. ” Hydrogen can serve as a zero emission fuel, whether combusted or used in a fuel cell. However, the primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, and to some extent coal.', 'The “ green ” in green hydrogen has only appeared in recent years, concurrent with the falling cost of wind and solar energy. The availability of low cost renewable energy has made it possible to lower the carbon footprint of electrolyzer systems, which deploy an electrical current to push hydrogen gas out of water.', 'So, now the issue is not so much whether or not green hydrogen is a real thing. The question is to what extent the interest in green hydrogen will pump up the overall demand for hydrogen too quickly, enabling the supply of fossil sourced hydrogen in the global economy to go up instead of down.', 'That brings us to Sinopec, aka China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, the well-known Bejing-based energy firm. Though best known for its fossil energy interests, Sinopec has been dabbling in biofuels and it looks like sustainable hydrogen is next in line.', 'Sinopec has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to transition out of fossil-sourced hydrogen. The company currently states its hydrogen output at a total of 3.5 million tons annually. Meanwhile, its newly launched “ Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project ” will only produce 20,000 tons annually.', 'That gap could grow instead of shrinking, if Sinopec follows through on a $ 4.6 billion pivot into natural gas and hydrogen. Also, according to the China Hydrogen Energy Alliance, the annual demand for hydrogen in China alone could grow into the range of 60 million tons annually by 2050.', 'Still, at 20,000 tons the new hydrogen project is nothing to sneeze at. It will be among the biggest such facilities in the world when it commences operations in June 2023, if not the biggest.', 'Actually, it could be the very biggest, by far. The firm Air Liquide has a large-scale electrolyzer facility up and running in Canada, but the output barely scrapes 3,300 tons annually ( 8.2 tonnes daily). Shell has an electrolyzer project under way in Germany that will produce 1,300 tons of hydrogen annually. If you know of any other big projects in the works, drop us a note in the comment thread.', 'If Sinopec calls it quits after a single 20,000-ton project, that would be the end of the story. However, the company has put out signals that the new facility is intended to provide a model for others to follow.', 'One signal is the scale of the company’ s commitment to the sustainable hydrogen infrastructure.', '“ As part of the project, Sinopec will build a new photovoltaic power station with an installed capacity of 300MW and annual power generation of 618 million kilowatt-hours, an electrolyzed water hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons, a spherical hydrogen storage tank with hydrogen storage capacity of 210,000 standard cubic meters, and hydrogen transmission pipelines with a capacity of 28,000 standard cubic meters per hour ( including supporting power transmission and transformation facilities), ” the company explains.', 'Another hint is the existence of a buyer. According to Sinopec, its Tahe Refining & Chemical division will use green hydrogen from the new facility to decarbonize its hydrogen production.', 'That brings up an interesting point about green hydrogen, which is that refinery operations account for a leading source of demand for hydrogen. So, all things being equal, green hydrogen would be deployed to enable the continued production of petroleum-based fuels and chemicals.', 'Well, that’ s the way the cookie crumbles. If the Tahe deal comes through, it would follow a broader trend of deploying renewable energy to in tandem with fossil sources. Sinopec, for example, is among the energy firms that use solar panels to power their oil fields.

At a mere 7 years of age, and just a few years after launching its first vehicle ( the XPeng G3 went on sales in December 2018), XPeng has wrapped up a year of sales totaling almost 100,000. In 2021, XPeng delivered 98,155 smart EVs, a 263% year-over-year increase.', 'In December, 16,000 vehicles were delivered, a 181% year-over-year increase compared to December 2020. There were 41,751 vehicles delivered in Q4 2021, which was a 222% year-over-year increase.', 'Reinforcing how impressive the 98,155 delivery figure for 2021 is, at the end of the year, XPeng reached just 137,953 cumulative deliveries.', 'All the more impressive, XPeng’ s monthly delivery target is 15,000 vehicles, and December was the second month in a row that was surpassed — and that’ s despite the global automotive chip shortage and other supply chain challenges.', 'In the case of the P7, deliveries were up 102%. GS deliveries were up 75%. The P5 was not on the market one year ago, but its sales did increase 134% month over month.', 'XPeng also noted that its broader charging and sales network in China has been growing “ rapidly. ” It had “ 661 branded supercharging stations across 228 cities and 311 physical retail stores in operation across 121 cities as of the end of November 2021. ”', 'All in all, XPeng’ s growth seems to be rolling out as the company hoped and planned, or even better. It’ s quite an uplifting sight to see another pure EV company scaling up production rapidly and achieving great sales success at a young age. Of course, the reference company need not be named, and we need not compare the two or pretend XPeng should exactly follow Tesla’ s ( whoops) path.

In the latest development, Sinopec has lent its financial muscle to the field. The company plans to have the proposed “ Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project ” up and running by 2023, which will add 20,000 tons of annual output to the small but growing supply of sustainable hydrogen in the global economy.', 'In past years, the green hydrogen field has run afoul of the greenwashing matrix. Hydrogen itself is not “ green. ” Hydrogen can serve as a zero emission fuel, whether combusted or used in a fuel cell. However, the primary source of hydrogen today is natural gas, and to some extent coal.', 'The “ green ” in green hydrogen has only appeared in recent years, concurrent with the falling cost of wind and solar energy. The availability of low cost renewable energy has made it possible to lower the carbon footprint of electrolyzer systems, which deploy an electrical current to push hydrogen gas out of water.', 'So, now the issue is not so much whether or not green hydrogen is a real thing. The question is to what extent the interest in green hydrogen will pump up the overall demand for hydrogen too quickly, enabling the supply of fossil sourced hydrogen in the global economy to go up instead of down.', 'That brings us to Sinopec, aka China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation, the well-known Bejing-based energy firm. Though best known for its fossil energy interests, Sinopec has been dabbling in biofuels and it looks like sustainable hydrogen is next in line.', 'Sinopec has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to transition out of fossil-sourced hydrogen. The company currently states its hydrogen output at a total of 3.5 million tons annually. Meanwhile, its newly launched “ Sinopec Xinjiang Kuqa Green Hydrogen Pilot Project ” will only produce 20,000 tons annually.', 'That gap could grow instead of shrinking, if Sinopec follows through on a $ 4.6 billion pivot into natural gas and hydrogen. Also, according to the China Hydrogen Energy Alliance, the annual demand for hydrogen in China alone could grow into the range of 60 million tons annually by 2050.', 'Still, at 20,000 tons the new hydrogen project is nothing to sneeze at. It will be among the biggest such facilities in the world when it commences operations in June 2023, if not the biggest.', 'Actually, it could be the very biggest, by far. The firm Air Liquide has a large-scale electrolyzer facility up and running in Canada, but the output barely scrapes 3,300 tons annually ( 8.2 tonnes daily). Shell has an electrolyzer project under way in Germany that will produce 1,300 tons of hydrogen annually. If you know of any other big projects in the works, drop us a note in the comment thread.', 'If Sinopec calls it quits after a single 20,000-ton project, that would be the end of the story. However, the company has put out signals that the new facility is intended to provide a model for others to follow.', 'One signal is the scale of the company’ s commitment to the sustainable hydrogen infrastructure.', '“ As part of the project, Sinopec will build a new photovoltaic power station with an installed capacity of 300MW and annual power generation of 618 million kilowatt-hours, an electrolyzed water hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons, a spherical hydrogen storage tank with hydrogen storage capacity of 210,000 standard cubic meters, and hydrogen transmission pipelines with a capacity of 28,000 standard cubic meters per hour ( including supporting power transmission and transformation facilities), ” the company explains.', 'Another hint is the existence of a buyer. According to Sinopec, its Tahe Refining &amp; Chemical division will use green hydrogen from the new facility to decarbonize its hydrogen production.', 'That brings up an interesting point about green hydrogen, which is that refinery operations account for a leading source of demand for hydrogen. So, all things being equal, green hydrogen would be deployed to enable the continued production of petroleum-based fuels and chemicals.', 'Well, that’ s the way the cookie crumbles. If the Tahe deal comes through, it would follow a broader trend of deploying renewable energy to in tandem with fossil sources. Sinopec, for example, is among the energy firms that use solar panels to power their oil fields. Coal mines and other extractive sites are also increasingly turning to renewables.', 'Sinopec also recently signed an agreement with Jinko Solar to build solar canopies at 18 Sinopec filling stations in China.

On May 13, company representatives and partners including the Japanese government celebrated the official opening of a new hydrogen pilot plant in Kawasaki, Japan. Operation start of this commercial-scale facility was in March 2024. The trial operation of four 0.8 MW modules is another milestone towards the realization of a commercial multi-module 100 MW-class alkaline water electrolysis system for green hydrogen production.', 'The hydrogen market is going to expand rapidly in the coming years. According to the Hydrogen Council, cumulative global installed capacity of water electrolyzers forecasted to reach approximately 300 GW by 2030. To meet this increasing demand, Asahi Kasei is currently developing the Aqualyzer™ alkaline water electrolyzer optimized for the production of green hydrogen.', 'In order to test this new system under realistic conditions in a multi-module setup, the company started constructing a pilot plant at its manufacturing site in Kawasaki in November 2022. The new facility started operation in March 2024, and on May 13, company representatives and partners gathered in Kawasaki to celebrate its official opening.', 'Masami Takenaka, Lead Executive Officer at Asahi Kasei and responsible for the company’ s hydrogen business, said, “ This pilot facility is milestone not only for Asahi Kasei, but also for the global hydrogen business in general. We believe that successfully operating our equipment in this test facility will be a door opener for commercial large-scale multi-module alkaline water electrolyzers and eventually the realization of a hydrogen society ”.', 'For the production of green hydrogen, electrolysis systems need to respond to fluctuating power supply from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar. In the pilot plant, four 0.8 MW Aqualyzer™ modules are being operated under realistic conditions, including operation during maintenance and low power supply during nighttime. In addition, the equipment is designed to simulate fluctuating power input from solar or wind power. By utilizing the data obtained from these trials, Asahi Kasei will further optimize the equipment design, operation methods, and control technology of the electrolysis system. With its multi-module approach, Asahi Kasei aims to combine up to ten modules with a capacity of 10 MW each, enabling commercial large-scale electrolysis systems with a capacity of up to 100 MW.', 'Asahi Kasei’ s hydrogen business is based on more than four decades of large-scale and long-term experience in the field of chlor-alkali electrolysis. Aiming for a total sales volume of ¥100 billion ( €600 million) by 2030, the company plans to start commercial business activities for its alkaline water electrolyzers in 2025.', 'The pilot plant in Kawasaki is an important step toward achieving this goal, after the successful long-term tests of its 10 MW single-stack alkaline-water electrolysis system at the Fukushima Energy Research Field ( FH2R) 1 in Namie, Fukushima, Japan, since 2020. The practical experience gained in Namie and the trial operation at the pilot plant in Kawasaki will further underpin Asahi Kasei’ s market entry with large-scale and highly reliable multi-module alkaline water electrolysis equipment. This experience will also be leveraged for the joint feasibility study with Gentari and JGC for a 60 MW-class electrolyzer in Malaysia targeted for 2027, as announced in November 2023.', 'Construction and operation of the pilot plant is supported by the “ Green Innovation Fund2 ” of Japan’ s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization ( NEDO).', 'This product profile summarizes the MAX-iR FTIR Gas Analyzer from Thermo Fisher Scientific.', 'The FT4 Powder Rheometer is a universal powder flow tester for measuring powder flow properties and powder behavior.', 'The TriStar III Plus is a high throughput surface area and porosity analzyer.', \"Laurence Molke, CEO of CycleØ, discusses the company's role in sustainable biomethane production and advancing decarbonization efforts.\", \"In this interview, Ieda Gomes Yell discusses the Isle of Man's Innovation Challenge and how it is fostering cleantech, AI, and FinTech solutions for sustainability and net-zero goals.\", \"This interview explores the intersection of policy, innovation, and commercialization within the UK's cleantech sector, with a focus on the initiatives and strategies being pursued by Cleantech for UK under Sarah Mackintosh's leadership.\", \"Hi, I 'm Azthena, you can trust me to find commercial scientific answers from AZoNetwork.com.\", 'A few things you need to know before we start.

colleagues, published in Communications Earth & Environment, projects that global warming would extend the Hudson Bay’ s ice-free period, shortening the resident polar bears’ hunting season.', 'Image Credit: outdoorsman/Shutterstock.com', 'The authors indicate that if temperatures rise by more than 2.1 degrees Celsius, the ice-free period in most of Hudson Bay may exceed the maximum fasting time that adult polar bears can tolerate.', 'Hudson Bay, located in the Arctic Ocean off the coast of northern Canada, is covered in sea ice during the season and is home to roughly 1,700 polar bears. Polar bears spend the winter on the sea ice, hunting seals, their preferred prey. When the ice melts in the spring, they come ashore and fast during the ice-free summer before returning to the sea ice in the melts.', 'Over the last three decades, the Hudson Bay area has warmed by more than one degree Celsius, extending the ice-free period from around 120 to 150 days. Polar bears in the bay rely on sea ice to hunt. Therefore, an extending ice-free period could affect both their survival rate during the fasting period and their reproductive success during the following hunting season.', \"In the western and southern Hudson Bay regions, where losses in polar bear populations have already been noted, Julienne Stroeve and colleagues estimated projected changes to the ice-free time by analyzing predictions from the IPCC's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 ( CMIP6) models. It is believed that polar bears could comfortably endure 183–218 days of ice-free time.\", 'The authors calculated that if global warming surpasses 2.1 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius, respectively, the ice-free period might last longer than the 183-day limit in the western and southern Hudson Bay regions.', \"Furthermore, they predict that seasonal ice melt will probably happen sooner in the spring. Since cubs are usually born between November and January, this might decrease the bears ' nursing time, which could lower their reproductive success.\", 'The scientists emphasize that if global warming is kept to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, the Hudson Bay polar bear population has a strong chance of survival.', 'Stroeve, J., et al.

battery components directly, reducing waste and reliance on foreign materials.', 'To ensure a successful transition to clean energy in the US, the production of electric vehicle ( EV) batteries must be significantly expanded. However, the US depends heavily on other countries for the materials required for these batteries, making it vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.', \"Argonne, Toyota Research Institute of North America, and Toyota's Battery Lifecycle Solutions group are investigating novel approaches to recycling battery components. If successful, this endeavor could strengthen and improve the circularity of domestic battery supply chains, allowing the United States to deploy EVs quickly.\", 'Most battery recycling involves chemically disassembling end-of-life battery components to produce the raw materials needed for manufacture. In contrast to this conventional method, a process known as direct recycling carefully separates the constituent parts of spent batteries. Manufacturers can reuse the components if they preserve their original structure effectively.', \"Batteries ' positive electrodes, or cathodes, have intricate chemical compositions. Their manufacturing procedures are, therefore, expensive and wasteful.\", 'Direct recycling can effectively minimize waste and manufacturing expenses by preserving the cathodes from batteries nearing their end of life. It may also reduce the requirement for pure raw materials.', 'Direct recycling is cutting-edge in the battery industry, there are a few startup companies with small-scale pilot projects underway. But implementation at commercial scale is still in need of innovations.', 'Argonne and Toyota Motor North America have signed a cooperative research and development agreement to create a direct recycling method for the cathodes in lithium-ion batteries, which are common in electric vehicles. The group focuses on cobalt, manganese, and nickel cathodes.', \"The partnership uses a successful, patent-pending direct recycling method created by the ReCell Center in Argonne. Batteries ' cathodes and anodes, or negative electrodes, are separated using a magnet.\", 'Toyota is supplying Argonne with both end-of-life and new plug-in hybrid EV batteries.', 'Besides recycling end-of-life batteries, we are also interested in recycling new batteries, manufacturers produce some battery cells that fail quality testing. We can potentially demonstrate that manufacturers can take cathodes out of failed cells and put them back into their production process. This capability could translate into huge cost savings.', \"At Argonne’ s Materials Engineering Research Facility ( MERF), researchers will use ReCell’ s direct recycling process on Toyota’ s battery cells to extract and regenerate the cathode material. Using coin cells, the team will evaluate different facets of the cathodes ' performance, such as capacity, lifespan, and impedance ( a form of resistance to electric current).\", \"Researchers at MERF plan to increase the recycling process if the cells function well. Then, using the extracted cathodes, Argonne's Cell Analysis, Modeling, and Prototyping Facility will construct larger pouch cells and evaluate the functionality of the cells. At the same time, Toyota will construct and test cells at its research facilities.\", 'The team will assess the performance of the recycled cathodes against that of new, pristine cathodes. They will also utilize Argonne’ s EverBatt model to analyze the costs and environmental impacts of implementing the direct recycling process for Toyota’ s batteries.', 'Albert Lipson concludes, “ Our goal is to prove that the process can make high-performing cathodes cost-effectively while reducing energy use and emissions, if we are successful, EV and battery manufacturers can potentially commercialize the process. ”', 'The research project is a component of the ReCell Center, which receives support from the DOE’ s Vehicle Technologies Office.', 'This product profile summarizes the MAX-iR FTIR Gas Analyzer from Thermo Fisher Scientific.', 'The FT4 Powder Rheometer is a universal powder flow tester for measuring powder flow properties and powder behavior.', 'The GeoPyc 1365 measured the envelope density of formed pieces without the use of hazardous materials.', \"Laurence Molke, CEO of CycleØ, discusses the company's role in sustainable biomethane production and advancing decarbonization efforts.\", \"In this interview, Ieda Gomes Yell discusses the Isle of Man's Innovation Challenge and how it is fostering cleantech, AI, and FinTech solutions for sustainability and net-zero goals.\", \"This interview explores the intersection of policy, innovation, and commercialization within the UK's cleantech sector, with a focus on the initiatives and strategies being pursued by Cleantech for UK under Sarah Mackintosh's leadership.\", \"Hi, I 'm Azthena, you can trust me to find commercial scientific answers from AZoNetwork.com.\", 'A few things you need to know before we start.

On May 13, company representatives and partners including the Japanese government celebrated the official opening of a new hydrogen pilot plant in Kawasaki, Japan. Operation start of this commercial-scale facility was in March 2024. The trial operation of four 0.8 MW modules is another milestone towards the realization of a commercial multi-module 100 MW-class alkaline water electrolysis system for green hydrogen production.', 'The hydrogen market is going to expand rapidly in the coming years. According to the Hydrogen Council, cumulative global installed capacity of water electrolyzers forecasted to reach approximately 300 GW by 2030. To meet this increasing demand, Asahi Kasei is currently developing the Aqualyzer™ alkaline water electrolyzer optimized for the production of green hydrogen.', 'In order to test this new system under realistic conditions in a multi-module setup, the company started constructing a pilot plant at its manufacturing site in Kawasaki in November 2022. The new facility started operation in March 2024, and on May 13, company representatives and partners gathered in Kawasaki to celebrate its official opening.', 'Masami Takenaka, Lead Executive Officer at Asahi Kasei and responsible for the company’ s hydrogen business, said, “ This pilot facility is milestone not only for Asahi Kasei, but also for the global hydrogen business in general. We believe that successfully operating our equipment in this test facility will be a door opener for commercial large-scale multi-module alkaline water electrolyzers and eventually the realization of a hydrogen society ”.', 'For the production of green hydrogen, electrolysis systems need to respond to fluctuating power supply from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar. In the pilot plant, four 0.8 MW Aqualyzer™ modules are being operated under realistic conditions, including operation during maintenance and low power supply during nighttime. In addition, the equipment is designed to simulate fluctuating power input from solar or wind power. By utilizing the data obtained from these trials, Asahi Kasei will further optimize the equipment design, operation methods, and control technology of the electrolysis system. With its multi-module approach, Asahi Kasei aims to combine up to ten modules with a capacity of 10 MW each, enabling commercial large-scale electrolysis systems with a capacity of up to 100 MW.', 'Asahi Kasei’ s hydrogen business is based on more than four decades of large-scale and long-term experience in the field of chlor-alkali electrolysis.

              "0  As we move toward a sustainable future, green hydrogen is a significant player in the renewable energy landscape. This article discusses how integrating green hydrogen into the grid through strategic partnerships can significantly advance carbon neutrality and energy security. It explores the innovation, infrastructure, and collaborative efforts essential for this transformation, leading toward a cleaner, more resilient energy system. Image Credit: Deemerwha studio/Shutterstock.com Green hydrogen, produced by water electrolysis using renewable energy sources, is at the forefront of the transition to sustainable energy systems. This process ensures that the production of hydrogen, a versatile energy carrier, does not emit carbon dioxide, aligning with global efforts toward carbon neutrality and bolstering energy security. As nations grapple with the urgent need to decarbonize their economies, green hydrogen has garnered significant attention worldwide from government bodies, industries, and environmental organizations. Various international strategies and agreements recognize its potential to serve as a key enabler of the energy transition, reflecting a collective commitment to sustainable, clean energy solutions as a pathway to mitigating climate change and ensuring a resilient energy future ( International Energy Agency, 2020; United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). The advancement of green hydrogen as a sustainable energy source significantly relies on multifaceted partnerships encompassing government, the private sector, and academia. These collaborative efforts are instrumental in overcoming the technological and economic hurdles associated with green hydrogen production and integration. For instance, the Hydrogen Council, a global initiative, exemplifies how over 80 energy, transport, and industrial companies worldwide have united to foster the hydrogen economy through shared investments and technology exchange ( Hydrogen Council, 2020). Government policies and regulatory frameworks also play a vital role in facilitating these partnerships by providing financial incentives and research funding and establishing clear hydrogen production, storage, and distribution standards. The European Union’ s Hydrogen Strategy, launched in 2020, outlines an ambitious roadmap for investments, infrastructure development, and research. It aims to significantly ramp up green hydrogen production by 2030 ( European Commission, 2020). Integrating green hydrogen into the existing energy grid necessitates significant technological innovations and the development of specialized infrastructure. Recent advancements in electrolyzer technology, crucial for green hydrogen production, have improved efficiency and reduced costs. Innovations in renewable energy capture, particularly from solar and wind sources, further bolster the feasibility of green hydrogen as a cost-effective energy solution ( International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022). However, the volatile nature of hydrogen requires the development of specialized storage and transportation infrastructure to handle and distribute it safely. Retrofitting the current energy grids to accommodate hydrogen energy presents a complex challenge, necessitating solutions for compatibility and safety. Strategies include developing hybrid systems that can manage both hydrogen and traditional energy forms, ensuring a smooth transition toward a hydrogen-based energy system ( Energy Transitions Commission, 2021). One notable example of green hydrogen integration is the project in Neom, Saudi Arabia, which, upon completion, will become the world's largest green hydrogen plant. This ambitious project, a partnership between ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM, harnesses solar and wind energy to produce up to 650 tons of green hydrogen daily. The project benefits from substantial financial investment, cutting-edge technology, and strong policy support from the Saudi government, aiming to position the kingdom as a leader in green hydrogen production ( Nereim, 2022). In Europe, the HyGreen Provence Project in France exemplifies regional collaboration for green hydrogen production involving ENGIE, the local government, and various technology providers. Scheduled for completion by 2028, the project aims to generate green hydrogen using solar power, highlighting the role of public-private partnerships in advancing the hydrogen economy. This initiative is expected to significantly contribute to France's energy transition efforts, reducing carbon emissions and creating jobs while providing a scalable model for green hydrogen integration across Europe ( ENGIE, 2021). Integrating green hydrogen into the energy grid faces several significant challenges, spanning technical, economic, and regulatory spheres. Technically, the lower energy efficiency of hydrogen production through electrolysis, compared to the direct use of electricity, poses a challenge, as does the need for safe storage and transportation solutions due to hydrogen's highly flammable nature ( Calabrese et al., 2024). Economically, the high initial costs of electrolyzer installations and the hydrogen storage and distribution infrastructure necessitate substantial and sustained investment. Policy and regulatory hurdles can impede its adoption, including the lack of global hydrogen production and use standards. To address these challenges, ongoing research is dedicated to improving electrolyzer efficiency and developing robust safety protocols. Pilot projects are testing hydrogen's viability in various energy systems. At the same time, international cooperation, as seen in the European Union’ s Hydrogen Strategy, seeks to harmonize regulations and encourage investment in green hydrogen technologies ( European Commission, 2020). Companies and academic institutions worldwide are pioneering green hydrogen technology, driving forward the energy sector's transition to sustainability. Siemens Energy and ITM Power exemplify corporate leadership in this field. They collaborate to enhance electrolyzer technology for more efficient hydrogen production. Their efforts aim to scale up production capacities, reduce costs, and make green hydrogen viable for a broader range of applications ( Siemens Energy, 2020). Within academia, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT) is at the forefront of green hydrogen research, developing novel methods to improve electrolysis efficiency and exploring innovative materials for hydrogen storage ( O'Neill, 2021). Then, there are startups like H2Pro that are pushing the boundaries with unique electrolysis technology, which promises higher efficiency and lower costs. This showcases the vital role of emerging companies in this sector ( H2Pro, 2021). Universities and industries often collaborate, bridging the gap between research and practical application. These partnerships facilitate technology transfer and provide workforce training, ensuring the next generation is equipped with the skills needed for a green hydrogen economy. Such collaborative efforts are crucial for accelerating the adoption of green hydrogen technologies and integrating them into our energy systems. The transformative potential of green hydrogen and renewable energy partnerships is a positive indicator for the global energy grid. Collaborative efforts across sectors are paramount in surmounting green hydrogen's challenges, emphasizing the need for increased investment, research, and supportive policies. As we advance, the collective endeavor to integrate green hydrogen into our energy systems is not just a pathway to sustainability but a cornerstone for securing a resilient and sustainable energy future for generations to come.

This article discusses how integrating green hydrogen into the grid through strategic partnerships can significantly advance carbon neutrality and energy security. It explores the innovation, infrastructure, and collaborative efforts essential for this transformation, leading toward a cleaner, more resilient energy system. Image Credit: Deemerwha studio/Shutterstock.com Green hydrogen, produced by water electrolysis using renewable energy sources, is at the forefront of the transition to sustainable energy systems. This process ensures that the production of hydrogen, a versatile energy carrier, does not emit carbon dioxide, aligning with global efforts toward carbon neutrality and bolstering energy security. As nations grapple with the urgent need to decarbonize their economies, green hydrogen has garnered significant attention worldwide from government bodies, industries, and environmental organizations. Various international strategies and agreements recognize its potential to serve as a key enabler of the energy transition, reflecting a collective commitment to sustainable, clean energy solutions as a pathway to mitigating climate change and ensuring a resilient energy future ( International Energy Agency, 2020; United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). The advancement of green hydrogen as a sustainable energy source significantly relies on multifaceted partnerships encompassing government, the private sector, and academia. These collaborative efforts are instrumental in overcoming the technological and economic hurdles associated with green hydrogen production and integration. For instance, the Hydrogen Council, a global initiative, exemplifies how over 80 energy, transport, and industrial companies worldwide have united to foster the hydrogen economy through shared investments and technology exchange ( Hydrogen Council, 2020). Government policies and regulatory frameworks also play a vital role in facilitating these partnerships by providing financial incentives and research funding and establishing clear hydrogen production, storage, and distribution standards. The European Union’ s Hydrogen Strategy, launched in 2020, outlines an ambitious roadmap for investments, infrastructure development, and research. It aims to significantly ramp up green hydrogen production by 2030 ( European Commission, 2020). Integrating green hydrogen into the existing energy grid necessitates significant technological innovations and the development of specialized infrastructure. Recent advancements in electrolyzer technology, crucial for green hydrogen production, have improved efficiency and reduced costs. Innovations in renewable energy capture, particularly from solar and wind sources, further bolster the feasibility of green hydrogen as a cost-effective energy solution ( International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022). However, the volatile nature of hydrogen requires the development of specialized storage and transportation infrastructure to handle and distribute it safely. Retrofitting the current energy grids to accommodate hydrogen energy presents a complex challenge, necessitating solutions for compatibility and safety. Strategies include developing hybrid systems that can manage both hydrogen and traditional energy forms, ensuring a smooth transition toward a hydrogen-based energy system ( Energy Transitions Commission, 2021). One notable example of green hydrogen integration is the project in Neom, Saudi Arabia, which, upon completion, will become the world's largest green hydrogen plant. This ambitious project, a partnership between ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM, harnesses solar and wind energy to produce up to 650 tons of green hydrogen daily. The project benefits from substantial financial investment, cutting-edge technology, and strong policy support from the Saudi government, aiming to position the kingdom as a leader in green hydrogen production ( Nereim, 2022). In Europe, the HyGreen Provence Project in France exemplifies regional collaboration for green hydrogen production involving ENGIE, the local government, and various technology providers. Scheduled for completion by 2028, the project aims to generate green hydrogen using solar power, highlighting the role of public-private partnerships in advancing the hydrogen economy.

Then, there are startups like H2Pro that are pushing the boundaries with unique electrolysis technology, which promises higher efficiency and lower costs. This showcases the vital role of emerging companies in this sector ( H2Pro, 2021). Universities and industries often collaborate, bridging the gap between research and practical application. These partnerships facilitate technology transfer and provide workforce training, ensuring the next generation is equipped with the skills needed for a green hydrogen economy. Such collaborative efforts are crucial for accelerating the adoption of green hydrogen technologies and integrating them into our energy systems. The transformative potential of green hydrogen and renewable energy partnerships is a positive indicator for the global energy grid. Collaborative efforts across sectors are paramount in surmounting green hydrogen's challenges, emphasizing the need for increased investment, research, and supportive policies. As we advance, the collective endeavor to integrate green hydrogen into our energy systems is not just a pathway to sustainability but a cornerstone for securing a resilient and sustainable energy future for generations to come.

There are now more than 157,000 solar installations statewide, and it is estimated that solar capacity in the state will double in the next four years. This is a critical step on the way to achieving Gov. Phil Murphy\\u2019 s goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. \\u201c I am thrilled New Jersey has reached this significant 4 GW milestone, \\u201d says Joseph L. Fiordaliso, president of New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. \\u201c New Jersey has been a leader in solar and our solar initiatives are a key part of our clean energy future. Through successful programs like Community Solar, we are ensuring equitable access to clean energy for all New Jerseyans. \\u201d New Jersey will continue to build on the 4 GW milestone by implementing a wide variety of solar programs throughout the rest of 2022. Following a successful two-year pilot program, board staff is targeting the third quarter of 2022 to issue the permanent program straw proposal for the Community Solar Energy Program. In year one of the pilot program, the board approved 45 applications representing almost 78 MW in solar energy capacity. In year two of the pilot program, the board approved 105 projects representing 165 MW of planned solar energy capacity; when fully developed, projects in both years have the cumulative capacity to serve approximately 24,000 low to moderate income subscribers. The board continues to advance the development of its Competitive Solar Incentive ( CSI) Program for grid supply and large net-metered solar. Staff has issued a straw proposal and has held three public comment sessions. Board staff anticipates launching this program later in 2022. The board will also be working to develop and implement a dual-use solar pilot program. Staff anticipates issuing a straw proposal later in the year. The board will continue to move forward with its grid modernization proceeding to solicit ideas for potential improvements to enable faster interconnection and higher levels of distributed energy resource ( DER) integration. In June, a draft report was presented at a public meeting with recommendations for interconnection reform, and the Board will continue its work aimed at modernizing the grid in the future.

Via those reports, you can explore the top automakers or auto brands in terms of their own internal EV share or in terms of their share of the overall EV market, or you can explore growth of the US EV market as a whole, or you can explore trends in auto brand sales broadly, or you can look at trends in EV market share, or you can look at model-by-model EV sales growth. There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what\\u2019 s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time. However, one thing I\\u2019 ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market. ( To be specific, I\\u2019 m referring to the fully electric, or BEV, market here.) Since I\\u2019 d already collected all of the core data from automakers over the years, plus a little bit of estimating for brands that lag behind the rest in the data they report ( Tesla included), this wasn\\u2019 t a huge challenge \\u2014 it just required creating a few more rows in my Google Sheet and generating a few more charts. However, I had not thought to do it until requested to by \\u201c Cypress \\u201d under a recent article. What a great suggestion! Why didn\\u2019 t I think of that? Well, let\\u2019 s just get to the charts and numbers. First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales. Wait, which powertrain is struggling with its sales trends? Dipping back into the big, horrible year of COVID, EV sales were up 356% in 2023 compared to 2020, while ICEV sales were up just slightly, 1%. Going even further back, looking at the pre-COVID numbers of 2019, we can see that EV sales were up 385% in 2023 compared to 2019, while ICEV sales were down 14%. So, of all the ways we\\u2019 ve looked at changes in the EV market and changes in the auto market as a whole, I think these comparisons most clearly highlight that EV sales have been growing strongly year after year, whereas the non-EV market needs to worry about what\\u2019 s happening and plan accordingly. Thanks to Cypress again for the request/idea for this report. You can also look at these numbers in a slightly different way via the two charts below.

There is some truth to those concerns \\u2014 tens of millions of electric cars are going to need a lot of electrons to keep their batteries charged. But what most people are blissfully unaware of is that data centers and AI are likely to consume half of all the electricity available from renewable energy resources such as solar and wind farms. The grid is under threat, but it\\u2019 s not from EVs, according to Wired. There is a new wind farm off the coast of Scotland that is supposed to be able to power 1.3 million homes, but Amazon has just announced it has spoken for more than half of that installation\\u2019 s 880 MW output. As the world\\u2019 s biggest companies race to build the infrastructure necessary to enable artificial intelligence, even remote Scottish wind farms are becoming indispensable, Wired says. Which raises this question \\u2014 Is this why the world is building all these renewable energy resources? We were under the impression that electricity would be used to heat and cool our homes and businesses. Do we the people have to foot the bill to build more transmission lines so Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can save every keystroke and data point in their insatiable quest to bring digital advertisers into our personal space to sell us more stuff? Inquiring minds want to know. Data center activity is increasing dramatically in Europe. Recently, Microsoft announced it would invest $ 3.2 billion for data centers in Sweden. Earlier this year, it said it would double its data center footprint in Germany, while also pledging a $ 4.3 billion data center investment for AI infrastructure in France. Amazon announced a network of data centers in the state of Brandenburg as part of a $ 8.5 billion investment in Germany, later dedicating another $ 17.1 billion to Spain. Google said it would spend $ 1.1 billion on its data center in Finland to drive AI growth. Does anyone notice how these numbers sound a lot like the money the automotive industry is investing in the transition to electric transportation? As the tech giants rush to build more data centers, behind the scenes there is panic around how to power them with renewable energy. Microsoft, Meta, and Google all plan to be net zero before 2030, while logistics-heavy Amazon has targeted 2040. In pursuit of that aim, the past decade has seen those companies hoover up renewable energy contracts with wind or solar companies. But all these projects rely on electricity grids, which are buckling under increased demand for clean energy. That\\u2019 s forcing the tech giants to think about their energy intensive futures and consider how they might operate their own off-grid power empires, outside the system. \\u201c There is a recognition that as power demand increases, the industry will have to find alternative energy sources, \\u201d says Colm Shorten, senior director of data center strategy at real estate services company JLL. He says that server farms are increasingly looking for \\u201c behind the wire \\u201d power supply, whether that\\u2019 s gas or diesel generators or more innovative technology such as green hydrogen. Oh, joy. Big data wants to build more thermal generation capacity so it can power its servers to absorb an endless stream of ones and zeros. Is this progress? Data centers need power for two primary purposes, Wired says. The first is to power the chips that enable computers to run algorithms or power video games. The second is to cool the servers so they don\\u2019 t overheat. Initiatives such as using liquid to cool the chips instead of air are expected to make modest energy savings, but forecasters like the International Energy Association still expect the demand for power to run data centers to double by 2026, thanks in part to the demands of artificial intelligence. For the past five years, tech companies have been on an increasingly frenzied shopping spree for renewable energy contracts known as power purchase agreements, which can enable data center operators to reserve power from a wind farm or solar site before the projects have even been built. In Denmark, there are solar farms paid for by Meta. In Norway, there are wind farms bankrolled by Google. As early adopters of these types of deals, tech companies have helped fuel Europe\\u2019 s now-thriving PPA market, says Christoph Zipf, spokesperson at WindEurope. This month, Microsoft struck the world\\u2019 s biggest renewable energy deal, signing a $ 10 billion contract for clean power across Europe and the US. Yet renewable energy still needs to run through the electricity grid, which is becoming a bottleneck \\u2014 especially in Europe \\u2014 as a surge of renewable producers try to connect to supply green electricity to a multitude of sectors. \\u201c We\\u2019 re going to run into energy constraints, \\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicted on a podcast in April. At Davos this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also warned that the status quo was not going to be able to provide AI with the power it needed to advance. \\u201c There\\u2019 s no way to get there without a breakthrough, \\u201d he said at a Bloomberg event. Grid operators are essentially saying the same thing. Ireland\\u2019 s state-owned electricity provider Eirgrid cited grid problems when it imposed an effective moratorium on Dublin data centers two years ago. When the municipality of Amsterdam introduced a similar pause, the Dutch Data Center Association, an industry group, hit back. \\u201c The current grid congestion in North Holland is blocking the growth of the data center sector, \\u201d it said in a statement. In the search for space on the grid, data centers are being pushed into parts of Europe where their arrival is more conspicuous, risking backlash from the smaller communities when they show up. That trend is already visible in Germany, according to Simon Hinterholzer, researcher at Germany\\u2019 s Borderstep Institute for Innovation and Sustainability. \\u201c In the past, the large majority of new data centers were being built in Frankfurt, \\u201d he says. \\u201c This has completely changed in the last two or three years. \\u201d He points to a 300 MW data center being built in the small town of Wustermark, as well as Amazon\\u2019 s latest investment in Brandenburg, the region bordering Berlin where more than 70 wind turbines were installed last year. This unquenchable thirst for renewable energy has led to more calls for data centers to find ways to survive off-grid. \\u201c The size of AI projects are getting bigger and bigger, reaching up to 1 gigawatt of power, which can not be supplied by the traditional power grids, \\u201d says Ricardo Abad, founder of data center Quark, which is working on a new site with an unnamed partner in Spain that will be able to generate its own power through onsite solar and wind power. These types of projects are technically still connected to the grid \\u2014 in case they want to offload excess power \\u2014 but they have the ability to operate independently, he says. The same year Dublin announced restrictions on data centers, Amazon also opened its largest ever onsite solar farm, spanning the roof and car park of its fulfillment center in Seville, Spain. Google\\u2019 s head of data center location strategy in Europe has also expressed interest in onsite renewables for its next generation of server farms. Microsoft and Meta denied running any projects that are entirely off-grid, but in Dublin, Microsoft is building a data center alongside its own backup gas power plant, meaning the site can keep running even if the grid operator kicks it off. The quest for clean electricity to feed the voracious needs of data centers is leading to some hitherto unimaginable ideas. \\u201c In the future, technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, renewable energy sources, and energy storage solutions will be crucial in making this possible, \\u201d says Kilian Wagner, an expert in sustainable digital infrastructures at German digital association Bitkom. OpenAI\\u2019 s Altman is already an investor in Helion Energy, an American nuclear fusion company that has also agreed to provide Microsoft with 50 megawatts of electricity from its first fusion nuclear plant, once operational. In the US, Microsoft has already been experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, touting them as a form of emission-free power backup. The demand for precious electricity to power data centers so people can play video games and mine cryptocurrencies may be startling to some. When society needs electricity to heat and cool our homes, make green cement and low carbon steel, and charge the batteries in tens of millions of electric cars, diverting resources to what basically are amusements seems completely unnecessary, if not downright silly. The US government has essentially decreed that green hydrogen developers need to supply their own electricity to run their electolyzers. Would a similar policy make sense for data centers? It seems pretty clear ordinary ratepayers are going to be asked to foot the bill to build the transmission infrastructure to operate these gigantic server farms \\u2014 at least until someone invents chips that consume 90% less electricity. It does seem that there ought to be a hierarchy that prioritizes who gets first dibs on renewable energy, and it\\u2019 s hard to imagine that data centers and AI deserve priority in any such allocation strategy.

        "        This method involves defining a dictionary of categories along with associated keywords. For each question, we count the occurrences of each keyword corresponding to every category. The category with the highest score is assigned to the question.\n",
        "        It is easily interpretable since we can trace the category decision to keyword matches. However, it is limited flexibility if questions use synonyms or varied phrasing that is not in the keyword list.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - BERT Sentence Approach:\n",
        "    In this approach, we use a SentenceTransformer model to encode each generated question into an embedding vector. We then compare these embeddings to precomputed embeddings of category prototype texts (i.e., descriptions of what each category should capture) using cosine similarity. The category with the highest similarity score is assigned to the question.\n",
        "    In this approach, Tthe quality of classification heavily depends on the choice of the prototype texts and the underlying model.\n",
        "    We have evaluated both methods and found that the BERT sentence approach outperformed the rule-based method. For patent questions, we even experimented with replacing the  [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model with the [AI-Growth-Lab/PatentSBERTa](https://github.com/AI-Growth-Lab/PatentSBERTa) model, which gave even better results in capturing nuanced technical details.\n",

Overall, these examples illustrate that our process successfully produced questions that are contextually grounded, relevant, and thought-provoking:\n",

        "  - The questions address both technical and real-world concerns—for example, one question explores the potential for recycling electric car batteries and its broader environmental and economic benefits, while another discusses the impact of global warming on wildlife. This shows that our QA pairs capture a range of topics within the cleantech domain.\n",

Questions connect technological aspects (like recycling challenges and grid stability with V2X technology) with behavioral or market trends (such as the influence of owning an electric vehicle on solar panel installations). This blend of technical and contextual elements makes the QA pairs more comprehensive.\n",

        "  - In general, the generated questions are clear and self-contained, meaning they can stand alone without needing extensive external context.

        "\n",
        "In addition to our generated QA pairs, we evalutate the human evaluation dataset(cleantech_rag_evaluation_data_2024-09-20.csv). This dataset is a small, high-quality evaluation set designed to benchmark the retrieval step in the RAG system. The human evaluators have already curated these 28 examples for quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "We pass this dataset through our classification and evaluation pipeline to see how well our automated QA evaluation compares. After running the examples through the pipeline (which includes our LLM-based critique agents and filtering logic), we found that only 2 out of the 28 examples were classified as good.\n",
        "\n",
        "This outcome highlights a few key insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - High Standards for Quality:\n",
        "  Our pipeline uses strict evaluation metrics for groundedness, relevance, and standalone clarity. The fact that only 2 examples met our threshold indicates that these metrics are effective at distinguishing high quality QA pairs from those that are ambiguous, irrelevant, or overly context dependent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Differences in Human vs. Automated Judgment:\n",
        "  Although the human evaluation dataset is curated for quality, our automated critique agents may apply slightly different standards. This gap can arise due to the inherent differences between human judgment and the deterministic nature of our LLM-based scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Potential Areas for Improvement:\n",
        "  The low pass rate (2/28) suggests that even the high-quality human-curated examples can sometimes fall short of our strict automatic evaluation criteria. This may be due to subtle issues in the questions or context that our models pick up on. It also indicates that our QA generation and evaluation techniques could be further fine-tuned to align better with human judgments.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Implications for the Retrieval Step:\n",
        "  Since this evaluation dataset is specifically for assessing the Retrieval component of our RAG system, maintaining a high-quality benchmark is crucial. Even though our automated pipeline filters aggressively, ensuring that the retrieval component consistently returns the top-quality examples is a key factor in the overall system performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, processing the human evaluation dataset demonstrates the robustness of our filtering and quality control process, while also revealing areas where our automated system might differ from human expectations. This insight is valuable for tuning both our QA generation methods and our evaluation criteria to create an optimal RAG system.\n"
