high number of charging cycles and presents unique benefits in terms of lower cost per delivered 
kwh of energy, as well as ability to support operation with no charging delays by receiving energy 
while in motion. The energy is delivered efficiently in short bursts at 6 times the nominal charging 
rate or higher. Majority of the round-trip energy consumption, happens during the climb with 
payload. Consequently, the charging infrastructure only has to be deployed for about 25% of the 
climb. The descending empty truck recharges by regenerative braking. The regenerative braking 
energy release can be maximised by loading the truck before descent with post mineral extraction 
crushed rock/overburden or soil, which can on descent be stowed in previously mined space. This 
mechanism can be used to make a off grid mine, fully renewable energy powered, utilising an onsite 
solar farm and gravitational energy storage. The stored gravitational energy released by, loaded 
dump trucks descending between sunset and sunrise from the surface to the pit or other lower 
elevation dump area.

storage site will have ability to time shift onsite daytime solar energy into the evening peak as well
