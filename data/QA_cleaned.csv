"," Lithium-ion batteries are highly recyclable, with around 90 percent of the cell being recoverable as a commercial activity. However, the recycling process is limited by the presence of hazardous materials such as copper, cobalt, and nickel, which must be removed before the cell components can be recycled. Additionally, the use of sodium-ion batteries as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries offers a potentially more cost-effective solution, as sodium is less costly and more plentiful than lithium. Nevertheless, reviewing and recycling electric car batteries is challenging due to the need for pyro and hydro-metallurgy processes to recover valuable metals, and companies such as Volvo, Nissan, and BMW are exploring innovative solutions, including the use of second-life batteries in applications like energy storage systems, solar panels, and even charging points for cars and bikes.",https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1597,Sustainability & Technological Innovation Questions,4.0,"The provided context discusses various recycling methods for lithium-ion batteries, including the recovery of precious metals, the use of second-life applications, and the development of new technologies such as solid-state batteries.

Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge.

That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America.

The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways.

The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project.', 'Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California.', 'The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain.', 'That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot.', '“ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed.', 'The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ”', 'The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground.', 'Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues.

Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid.

However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity.', 'The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs.', 'On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase.', '“ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America.', 'As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere.', 'Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too.', '“ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains.', 'The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy.', 'So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways.

Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons.

75,"['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid.

Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve.', 'Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share.', '“ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports.', 'That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead.', 'Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020. ( It seems the transition could have been completed sooner.) Also, the German phaseout was planned for earlier this year but got delayed.', ""“ The 1,200 employees who previously worked in engine construction will now be retrained and deployed in other areas in future — either at the Munich plant or at other BMW locations. The Works Council expressly welcomed the decision and multi-million euro investment in 2020 and spoke of a ‘ role model for a successfully organised transformation in German industry. ' ”"", 'Without a doubt, as Luke Tonachel of the NRDC just reported in relation to the US and the UAW’ s recent strike, auto industry union workers can see the writing on the wall and don’ t want to be left out of the EV transition. Because if they are, they could be left out in the cold altogether.', 'BMW produces the i4, i5, i7, and iX in Germany. By 2030, one has to think the idea of BMW producing engines in Germany will feel like ancient history, and the company will be manufacturing several more electric vehicle models as well as EV batteries within its borders.

In between, though, a reader contributed what might be the most interesting comment of all. Writing the comment under Steve’ s article, “ UjiBebek ” contributes the following:', 'During a recent trip to Thailand I noticed a significant number of Chinese EVs on the roads. According to data published recently, EVs sales in the first five months of 2024 increased by 31% to 43k units, while total vehicles sales dropped by 24%, down to 260k units.', 'I discussed this topic with a local friend, and I found interesting the impact EVs are having on the automotive market overall. The availability of cheap imports from China has triggered a generalized reduction in the prices of cars in the Kingdom.', 'New cars prices dropped significantly, with price reductions of up to 20% applied by dealers on the MSRP of some vehicles, especially those which are in direct competition against the Chinese imports. And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share. Thailand should soon be at around one out of every five new cars sold being electric, then one out of every four new cars sold being electric, then. …', 'But exponential growth is one thing. Disrupting pricing in the auto market and essentially chasing some companies out of it in the process is something else.', 'Cheap electric cars from China seem to be doing something special in Thailand.

However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity.', 'The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs.', 'On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase.', '“ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America.', 'As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere.', 'Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too.', '“ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains.', 'The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy.', 'So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways.

The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot.', '“ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed.', 'The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ”', 'The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground.', 'Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues. Among other recent battery recycling moves, last fall GM put up a stake in Series A financing for the recycling firm Lithion.

90,"['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid.

And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months).

That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here).

Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works.

104,"['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid.

' ”"", 'Without a doubt, as Luke Tonachel of the NRDC just reported in relation to the US and the UAW’ s recent strike, auto industry union workers can see the writing on the wall and don’ t want to be left out of the EV transition.

And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share. Thailand should soon be at around one out of every five new cars sold being electric, then one out of every four new cars sold being electric, then. …', 'But exponential growth is one thing.

Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways.

Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid.

And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge.

Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works.

"," BMW and PG&E are working together to demonstrate how EV batteries can be used to power electric devices and contribute to grid stability. This involves using V2X technology to enable EVs to act as flexible grid resources, storing energy during periods of excess production and releasing it back into the grid when needed, and potentially providing backup power in the event of an outage. This approach aims to reduce the burden on the grid and increase the use of renewable energy.",https://cleantechnica.com/2023/05/22/bmw-v2x-and-the-death-of-the-gasmobile/,Sustainability & Technological Innovation Questions,5.0,"The question is clearly and unambiguously answerable with the given context, as the article provides detailed information about the partnership between BMW and PG&E to demonstrate the use of V2X technology for grid stability and renewable energy integration.

Tesla has a gigafactory in China but none in India. India and China have had a number of disputes over the years, and Indian Prime Minister Modi has told Tesla in no uncertain terms that its Chinese-made automobiles are not welcome in his country. Negotiations have been on again/off again between Tesla and India for several years, with little forward progress being made. India imposes an import duty of up to 100% on vehicles manufactured in other countries.', 'In June, Elon Musk tore himself away from his chores as the owner of T * itter to visit with the Indian prime minister personally in the US, after which he pledged to begin manufacturing Tesla automobiles in India “ as soon as humanly possible. ” And why not? India is now the fourth largest new car market in the world, and yet Tesla — which is committed to promoting the EV revolution in every nation on Earth — has virtually no presence there.', 'After the meeting, Modi tweeted, “ Great meeting you today @ elonmusk! We had multifaceted conversations on issues ranging from energy to spirituality. ” For his part, Musk said he planned to visit India personally next year.', 'Now just a few weeks later, Reuters reports that Tesla is ready to invest in India by building a factory there that would have an annual production capacity of half a million vehicles. The report was first published by the Times of India and cited government sources. Those sources also claim that Tesla intends to use the factory in India as an export base to ship cars to other Asian countries.', 'A team from Tesla went to India in May for preliminary discussions with officials in that country about what incentives might be offered by the government for automobile and battery manufacturing, according to Reuters.', '“ Tesla has come to us with an ambitious plan and we are confident the movement will be positive this time around, especially as it involves both local manufacturing and exports, ” sources said. In fact it appears Tesla intends to start by exporting cars first in order to accurately measure the demand in Asian markets.', 'Building a new Tesla factory in India is good news, but here’ s the real meat in the stew: According to insiders with knowledge of the talks that have been going on since May, the starting price of the vehicles manufactured in India will be 2 million rupees, which translates at today’ s exchange rate to $ 24,401. Tesla does not currently offer a car at the price, so it is unclear at the moment what vehicle Tesla has in mind.', 'There have been rumors and vague statements floating around for a year of more about a so-called Model 2 or Model C or call it what you want that will sell for less that $ 25,000. Although, Tesla has been very tightlipped about how far along such a vehicle is, and when exactly it may find its way into production. Some observers think the new factory in Mexico will be the first to build such a car, and that it could do so next year. If that’ s the case, what about India too?', 'By the way, if that price seems low, there are several electric cars available to customers in India that are less expensive. The MG Comet sells for around $ 12,000 and the Tata Nexon EV lists for around $ 18,000. At the present time, the Tata is the best selling electric car in the country.', 'The Indian commerce and industry ministry is leading the talks with Tesla and hopes to put together a “ good deal ” while maintaining a level playing field, as talks now involve both local manufacturing and exports, according to local media sources.', 'As we reported last month, prime minister Modi was a staunch advocate for electric vehicles a few years ago.

Perhaps things are changing, though.', 'Indian manufacturing powerhouse Tata Group is now making a big move into the space, reportedly investing 130 billion rupees ( $ 1.58 billion) into a lithium-ion battery cell factory in the country. At the moment, only 1% of Indian auto sales are EV sales, but Tata Motors is the leader in the sector.', 'That battery factory won’ t be coming online any time soon, however. Construction is scheduled to begin sometime in next 3 years. It is slated to have an annual production capacity of 20 GWh, with the possibility of increasing that to 40 GWh in a few years. The Tata battery factory will be located in Sanand, in northern Gujarat.', 'There was big news about battery raw materials in India recently. A large supply of lithium — almost 6 million tons — has been discovered in the states of Jammu & Kashmir, and the government is expected to begin auctioning off the mining rights to those reserves later this year.', 'The reserves, confirmed earlier this year, have placed India among the top five countries for lithium reserves in the world. The reserves are said to have a high purity and are graded at 500 parts per million compared to the normal grade of 220 parts per million.', 'India’ s minister for transportation has expressed optimism about the country’ s improved prospects as an EV powerhouse following conformation of the reserves’ purity and leading to claims that India could become the largest EV manufacturer in the world using them. The Indian government aims to achieve a 30% share of electric vehicles in private cars, 70% in commercial vehicles, and 80% in two- and three-wheeled vehicles by 2030.', 'India may be the largest country by population, but it lags far behind other large countries in terms of manufacturing prowess. By opening the door to Tesla, it could begin the transfer of technical skills it needs to become one of the world’ s leading economies.

The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project.', 'Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California.', 'The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain.', 'That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot.', '“ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed.', 'The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project.

Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline.

CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres.

Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires.

The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks.', 'In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," What type of electrolysis is likely to hold great potential, but is still in early stages of commercialization, due to using a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte?

Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement.', 'Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good.', 'Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.', 'This may be because climate change is impacting Canada’ s forests or because policy makers decide that in order to meet the world’ s Paris commitments, all CO2 emissions need to be treated equally.', 'As a result, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is having to look to bioenergy with CCS ( or BECCS). This is not because it is seeking to avoid abatement but rather because it was an early adopter of clean technologies and now has limited viable options to reduce emissions further.', 'Implementing BECCS is the most economically and technologically feasible pathway to further emissions reductions of total carbon at many Canadian pulp and paper facilities. As forest management practices continue to improve to maximise the carbon sequestered in Canada’ s forests and long-lived wood products, there is also a realistic potential for the use of BECCS to contribute to the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere and become a negative emissions technology ( NET).', 'It is widely accepted, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC), that the use of NETs will be essential to meet our commitment to 1.5C.', 'At this juncture in the race to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there is no silver bullet.']"," Does the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology pose a barrier to further emissions reductions in the pulp and paper sector, or is it necessary to achieve net-zero emissions?

While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," What are the key drawbacks of using alkaline electrolysis in hydrogen production, in terms of producing high-purity hydrogen?

Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper.

By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.', 'This may be because climate change is impacting Canada’ s forests or because policy makers decide that in order to meet the world’ s Paris commitments, all CO2 emissions need to be treated equally.', 'As a result, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is having to look to bioenergy with CCS ( or BECCS). This is not because it is seeking to avoid abatement but rather because it was an early adopter of clean technologies and now has limited viable options to reduce emissions further.', 'Implementing BECCS is the most economically and technologically feasible pathway to further emissions reductions of total carbon at many Canadian pulp and paper facilities. As forest management practices continue to improve to maximise the carbon sequestered in Canada’ s forests and long-lived wood products, there is also a realistic potential for the use of BECCS to contribute to the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere and become a negative emissions technology ( NET).', 'It is widely accepted, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC), that the use of NETs will be essential to meet our commitment to 1.5C.', 'At this juncture in the race to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there is no silver bullet.']"," Can Canada's pulp and paper sector rely on carbon abatement measures other than Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to achieve net zero emissions, or is CCS necessary for further emissions reductions?

161,"['The challenges to making green hydrogen production commercially viable can be tackled if the right technology and economic infrastructure are in place, writes Maria Anez-Lingerfelt, senior scientist at Pall Corporation.', 'The demand for new green energy strategies is increasing and hydrogen is regarded as a key factor in meeting international emissions targets and achieving net zero by 2050. The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks.', 'In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," What are the main challenges in producing green hydrogen at a large scale and making it commercially viable?

"," The main challenges in producing green hydrogen at a large scale and making it commercially viable include the need for increased power capacity from renewable energy sources, such as wind farms and solar plants, to power the electrolysis process, and the optimization of the production process using electrolysers. Additionally, the offline processes, such as filtration, separation, and purification, require several unit operations to achieve the required purity levels, which can be costly and technically challenging, particularly when it comes to meeting stringent regulations around gas purity specifications.",https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/447538/turning-the-green-hydrogen-dream-into-reality/,Sustainability & Technological Innovation Questions,4.0,"The provided context discusses the challenges of producing green hydrogen at a large scale and making it commercially viable, including the need for increased power capacity, optimization of the production process, and further processing to remove contaminants.

162,"['Carbon capture and storage ( CCS) has long been touted as part of the solution to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.', 'Fast forward to 2023 and global policy experts increasingly identify CCS as an essential part of the global path to maintaining the Paris Agreement’ s target of limiting global temperate rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.', 'One of the persistent arguments against the use of CCS is that it will prolong the transition away from the use of fossil fuels and thereby prolong the ‘ fossil fuel age’. Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement.', 'Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good.', 'Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.', 'This may be because climate change is impacting Canada’ s forests or because policy makers decide that in order to meet the world’ s Paris commitments, all CO2 emissions need to be treated equally.', 'As a result, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is having to look to bioenergy with CCS ( or BECCS). This is not because it is seeking to avoid abatement but rather because it was an early adopter of clean technologies and now has limited viable options to reduce emissions further.', 'Implementing BECCS is the most economically and technologically feasible pathway to further emissions reductions of total carbon at many Canadian pulp and paper facilities. As forest management practices continue to improve to maximise the carbon sequestered in Canada’ s forests and long-lived wood products, there is also a realistic potential for the use of BECCS to contribute to the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere and become a negative emissions technology ( NET).', 'It is widely accepted, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC), that the use of NETs will be essential to meet our commitment to 1.5C.', 'At this juncture in the race to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there is no silver bullet.']"," Is the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) necessary for Canada's pulp and paper sector to meet the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping global warming under 1.5°C?

The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks.', 'In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, what are some of the major technical challenges that need to be overcome, such as mentioned in the text?

Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement.', 'Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good.', 'Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.', 'This may be because climate change is impacting Canada’ s forests or because policy makers decide that in order to meet the world’ s Paris commitments, all CO2 emissions need to be treated equally.', 'As a result, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is having to look to bioenergy with CCS ( or BECCS). This is not because it is seeking to avoid abatement but rather because it was an early adopter of clean technologies and now has limited viable options to reduce emissions further.', 'Implementing BECCS is the most economically and technologically feasible pathway to further emissions reductions of total carbon at many Canadian pulp and paper facilities. As forest management practices continue to improve to maximise the carbon sequestered in Canada’ s forests and long-lived wood products, there is also a realistic potential for the use of BECCS to contribute to the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere and become a negative emissions technology ( NET).', 'It is widely accepted, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC), that the use of NETs will be essential to meet our commitment to 1.5C.', 'At this juncture in the race to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there is no silver bullet.']"," Can the use of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the pulp and paper sector in Canada be seen as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement efforts, and if so, how can this misconception be addressed?

The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks.', 'In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," What are the main technical challenges in producing green hydrogen at scale, and what technologies are being developed to overcome them?

Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement.', 'Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good.', 'Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.', 'This may be because climate change is impacting Canada’ s forests or because policy makers decide that in order to meet the world’ s Paris commitments, all CO2 emissions need to be treated equally.', 'As a result, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is having to look to bioenergy with CCS ( or BECCS). This is not because it is seeking to avoid abatement but rather because it was an early adopter of clean technologies and now has limited viable options to reduce emissions further.', 'Implementing BECCS is the most economically and technologically feasible pathway to further emissions reductions of total carbon at many Canadian pulp and paper facilities. As forest management practices continue to improve to maximise the carbon sequestered in Canada’ s forests and long-lived wood products, there is also a realistic potential for the use of BECCS to contribute to the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere and become a negative emissions technology ( NET).', 'It is widely accepted, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC), that the use of NETs will be essential to meet our commitment to 1.5C.', 'At this juncture in the race to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there is no silver bullet.']"," Can the use of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology in Canada's pulp and paper sector be seen as a detrimental threat to reducing greenhouse gas emissions when the sector is trying to transition away from fossil fuels?

"," No, according to the text, CCS technology is not a threat to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even in the pulp and paper sector. In fact, BCFS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) can be a pathway for further emissions reductions, and is considered an essential technology for meeting the Paris Agreement's target of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C, and is seen as a means to achieve negative emissions (NET) technology and draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/482131/carbon-abatement-or-ccs-the-answer-is-both/,Sustainability & Technological Innovation Questions,5.0,"The question can be answered unambiguously with the given context, as the context provides a clear and concise overview of the role of CCS technology in the pulp and paper sector, its limitations, and the sector's efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

This is necessary because the state's grid is designed to prioritize electricity supply over renewable energy sources, even if it means taking away interruption of solar generation. This system is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and is intended to ensure a stable grid by helping to prevent grid instability and power outages. This procedure disrupts the benefits that solar generation is meant to provide, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.

The term ""increasing curtailment"" could refer to varied factors such as grid overload, interruptions, storage shortages, or even environmental factors, but without additional context, it is hard to pinpoint a specific reason for the limitation of a particular form of renewable energy source, particularly solar generation."
215,"['Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity.', 'Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

225,"['Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity.', 'Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.
