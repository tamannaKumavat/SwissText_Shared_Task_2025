1,"** What is the purpose of Asahi Kasei’s new hydrogen pilot plant in Kawasaki?  
**","['The Japanese technology company Asahi Kasei is further accelerating its hydrogen business activities. On May 13, company representatives and partners including the Japanese government celebrated the official opening of a new hydrogen pilot plant in Kawasaki, Japan. Operation start of this commercial-scale facility was in March 2024. The trial operation of four 0.8 MW modules is another milestone towards the realization of a commercial multi-module 100 MW-class alkaline water electrolysis system for green hydrogen production.', 'The hydrogen market is going to expand rapidly in the coming years. According to the Hydrogen Council, cumulative global installed capacity of water electrolyzers forecasted to reach approximately 300 GW by 2030. To meet this increasing demand, Asahi Kasei is currently developing the Aqualyzer™ alkaline water electrolyzer optimized for the production of green hydrogen.', 'In order to test this new system under realistic conditions in a multi-module setup, the company started constructing a pilot plant at its manufacturing site in Kawasaki in November 2022. The new facility started operation in March 2024, and on May 13, company representatives and partners gathered in Kawasaki to celebrate its official opening.', 'Masami Takenaka, Lead Executive Officer at Asahi Kasei and responsible for the company’ s hydrogen business, said, “ This pilot facility is milestone not only for Asahi Kasei, but also for the global hydrogen business in general. We believe that successfully operating our equipment in this test facility will be a door opener for commercial large-scale multi-module alkaline water electrolyzers and eventually the realization of a hydrogen society ”.', 'For the production of green hydrogen, electrolysis systems need to respond to fluctuating power supply from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar. In the pilot plant, four 0.8 MW Aqualyzer™ modules are being operated under realistic conditions, including operation during maintenance and low power supply during nighttime. In addition, the equipment is designed to simulate fluctuating power input from solar or wind power. By utilizing the data obtained from these trials, Asahi Kasei will further optimize the equipment design, operation methods, and control technology of the electrolysis system. With its multi-module approach, Asahi Kasei aims to combine up to ten modules with a capacity of 10 MW each, enabling commercial large-scale electrolysis systems with a capacity of up to 100 MW.', 'Asahi Kasei’ s hydrogen business is based on more than four decades of large-scale and long-term experience in the field of chlor-alkali electrolysis. Aiming for a total sales volume of ¥100 billion ( €600 million) by 2030, the company plans to start commercial business activities for its alkaline water electrolyzers in 2025.', 'The pilot plant in Kawasaki is an important step toward achieving this goal, after the successful long-term tests of its 10 MW single-stack alkaline-water electrolysis system at the Fukushima Energy Research Field ( FH2R) 1 in Namie, Fukushima, Japan, since 2020. The practical experience gained in Namie and the trial operation at the pilot plant in Kawasaki will further underpin Asahi Kasei’ s market entry with large-scale and highly reliable multi-module alkaline water electrolysis equipment. This experience will also be leveraged for the joint feasibility study with Gentari and JGC for a 60 MW-class electrolyzer in Malaysia targeted for 2027, as announced in November 2023.', 'Construction and operation of the pilot plant is supported by the “ Green Innovation Fund2 ” of Japan’ s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization ( NEDO).', 'This product profile summarizes the MAX-iR FTIR Gas Analyzer from Thermo Fisher Scientific.', 'The FT4 Powder Rheometer is a universal powder flow tester for measuring powder flow properties and powder behavior.', 'The TriStar III Plus is a high throughput surface area and porosity analzyer.', ""Laurence Molke, CEO of CycleØ, discusses the company's role in sustainable biomethane production and advancing decarbonization efforts."", ""In this interview, Ieda Gomes Yell discusses the Isle of Man's Innovation Challenge and how it is fostering cleantech, AI, and FinTech solutions for sustainability and net-zero goals."", ""This interview explores the intersection of policy, innovation, and commercialization within the UK's cleantech sector, with a focus on the initiatives and strategies being pursued by Cleantech for UK under Sarah Mackintosh's leadership."", ""Hi, I 'm Azthena, you can trust me to find commercial scientific answers from AZoNetwork.com."", 'A few things you need to know before we start.

Electric car batteries are highly recyclable, with around 90 percent of the cell being recoverable as a commercial activity. This is achievable if the recycling companies profit from the recycling process. Wiring and plastics can be stripped and recycled. The precious mined metals contained in the battery cell electrolyte can be dangerous to access since they are flammable, explosive and very toxic.

The aim is to discover how long batteries last in those situations and work out the sustainability and financial benefits.', 'Volvo reveals each battery produces around six to eight tons of CO2, which requires a lot of raw metals, but it is trying to establish if extending battery life is worthwhile, or whether it is better to recycle immediately.', 'Nissan uses second-life batteries from its Leaf car model for energy storage, with an off-the-shelf home or commercial unit called xStorage as a rival to Tesla’ s Powerwall.', 'Honda is planning a collaboration with Societe Nouvelle d’ Affinage des Metaux ( SNAM) to collect and recycle batteries for second-life use or the extraction of precious elements.', 'BMW announced a partnership with Off Grid Energy for a sustainable second-life solution for end-of-life BMW and MINI electric and hybrid models.

**Q:** Why are cobalt mining practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo a concern for lithium-ion battery production?  
**A:** Cobalt mining in the DRC has raised ethical and environmental concerns due to reports of child labor, human rights abuses, and ecological damage from pollution and hazardous mining conditions. This has prompted efforts to improve recycling and explore alternative battery materials.  

---  

**Q:** What are the advantages of solid-state batteries over traditional lithium-ion batteries?  
**A:** Solid-state batteries are safer (less flammable), store more energy, charge faster, and use solid electrolytes that are more stable than liquid ones. However, they remain expensive to produce and difficult to scale, limiting current adoption in electric vehicles.
