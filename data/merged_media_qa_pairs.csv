" What is a significant development in the electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure in Mexico, announced by Volvo Cars and Evergo?

","['With all of the EV news coming out of the United States, Canada, China, and Europe, sometimes it’ s easy to forget about some of our neighbors to the south. But that’ s a mistake. Many upcoming EVs for the U.S. market are being built in Mexico, and they need the benefits of electric drive down there just as much as we do. But, for my family down there, it’ s probably going to be a long time before I see them come visit in an EV, both because they’ re difficult to afford and because charging is hard to come by.', 'The same would be true if I wanted to take my Bolt to to visit the little town where my grandmother grew up. Safety issues aside, making the 400-mile round trip isn’ t really feasible, because the whole area is a giant charging dead zone. This is a real shame, because it’ s just a 3–4 hour trip into a neighboring state, and it wouldn’ t be a problem if the states were both on this side of the border. Seeing yet another barrier grow between us all isn’ t great.', 'That’ s why I thought it was great news when a press release came across the desk about a deal to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico. Volvo Cars has partnered with Evergo, a leading charging station platform for electric vehicles in the region, as part of its electrification strategy. This alliance aims to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide Volvo customers in Mexico and Latin America with access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers.', '“ Each of the actions we implement are firm steps that help us connect cities. We not only want to promote our objectives, we begin to make them a reality by offering an infrastructure solution that allows the mobility of users who have opted for an electric car, ” said Raymundo Cavazos, general director of Volvo Car México.', 'More importantly, it’ s no small deal. The collaboration aims to install 2,295 chargers in Mexico over the next 3 years, including 803 DC fast charging stations ( which the press release refers to as “ superchargers ”). The companies say this expansion will enhance range freedom for users by providing greater charging access along major routes, but they did not provide further specifics about locations.', 'But, they did share that 2,213 kilometers of tourist routes will soon connect more parts of the country. Chargers are already installed in the Puebla-San Luis Potosí Corridor, and by the end of 2024, new routes like Mexico City-Acapulco, Guadalajara-Puerto Vallarta, Tijuana-Ensenada, Mérida-Cancún, and Monterrey-McAllen will be connected.', '“ This alliance leads us towards an increasingly promising horizon in terms of electric mobility in Mexico. Through this shared commitment, we ensure that in the short term, a greater number of users can enjoy the benefits of more sustainable mobility, backed by the most advanced technology on the market, and with the necessary confidence to reach the main destinations. of the country without worrying about running out of charge, ” said Daniel López, commercial director of Evergo Mexico.', 'The Evergo and Volvo alliance also extends to Latin America, enabling Volvo users in multiple countries to access the charging network available in Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. The Swedish company also collaborates with VEMO, a cleantech company that integrates the entire clean mobility ecosystem. Together, they have agreed on the installation of 70 chargers in shopping centers and universities.', '“ By 2025 we have a commitment that half of Volvo vehicles will be fully electric. Our mission is to take care of people, future generations and the environment, electrification plays an essential role in achieving this goal, ” added Raymundo Cavazos, CEO of Volvo Car Mexico.', 'Since launching the Volvo XC40 Recharge in 2021, Volvo has provided a charger to each of its electric vehicle customers, resulting in around 800 home charging network chargers across Latin America as well.', 'Finally, the companies said that starting next year, Volvo electric vehicles will be equipped with the NACS-type connector in Mexico just as they will in the United States and Canada, enabling brand users to utilize Tesla’ s chargers across North America. In Mexico, there will be a total of 660 chargers available, including 60 Superchargers, allowing for even more expansion of charging opportunities for Volvo customers.', 'Considering that there are only 60 Supercharger stations in Mexico and a few dozen CCS or CHAdeMO stations, the deal Volvo and Evergo announced will make a big impact. But, at the same time, it’ s not cause for complacency.', 'Economic trade beyond just tourism to the most popular destinations needs to be a priority. And economic trade isn’ t all semi-trucks and big maquiladora plants along the border, either. There are so, so many small businesses and family businesses that depend on going back and forth across the border in smaller vehicles, too.', 'In other words, Mexico is a much more important trading partner than many people realize, in terms of both current reality and in the potential that exists.', 'To watch the United States and Canada embark on a big move to a different model for fueling our transportation systems is great, but we risk losing circulation to our feet and losing them if we don’ t make sure all of our neighbors are making the journey with us. And don’ t take that as any insult to Mexico, because as anybody who lost their feet can tell you, they’ re something you can’ t easily live without.', 'For this reason, we should encourage more automotive manufacturers to expand their charging presence along highways in Mexico. We should also encourage the U.S. and Canadian governments to pitch in and expand charging opportunities the same way they have been doing in their own countries.', 'To many people, the language and cultural barriers may seem insurmountable, and Mexico might seem like some far-off and exotic place, but to many of us, it’ s both family and an essential trading partner. Leaving it behind would be a mistake of epic proportions.', 'Featured image provided by Volvo Mexico and Evergo.', ""Jennifer Sensiba is a long time efficient vehicle enthusiast, writer, and photographer.

" How do negative bidding systems in offshore wind energy auctions affect the financial burden of wind energy development in Europe?

","['Germany’ s Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA or Federal Network Agency) recently unveiled the outcomes of its largest-ever offshore wind auction, awarding 7 GW of new capacity. This significant achievement marks a substantial milestone in Germany’ s quest for renewable energy expansion and is worth about €12.6 billion or $ 13.96 billion.', 'At the Global Wind Energy Summit in Australia last month, offshore wind experts discussed the landmark auction started in April and completed in the middle of July with cautious excitement. Two of Europe’ s big oil companies, BP and Total Energies, won the bids in the North Sea totaling 6 GW and 1 GW in the Baltic Sea.', 'This September, renewed interest in the German auction came about because of the failure of the UK to secure takers for its own offshore wind projects.', 'But the win of BP and Total was seen differently and the impact of the negative bidding required project developers to essentially pay for the privilege of building their wind farms. While it undoubtedly ensured a cost-effective outcome for the government, the repercussions are far-reaching.', 'As an example, wind energy expert Ørsted chose to exit the German seabed lease auction before its completion this September, a Reuters report said last July. The report also indicated that company executives “ expressed concerns about high prices. ”', 'The negative bidding system inherently transfers additional costs to offshore wind developers, who must now decide where to allocate these expenses. The wind supply chain, which is already grappling with inflation and surging input costs, may find itself further burdened. Alternatively, consumers, who are already contending with rising electricity prices and the overall cost of living, may bear the brunt of this financial burden.', 'The Bundesnetzagentur is steadfast in its model to achieve its ambitious energy targets.', 'The outcome of this auction compels offshore wind developers to foot the staggering €12.6 billion bill to the German Government. Notably, 90% of these funds will be allocated to financing grid connection costs, while 5% will be devoted to protecting maritime biodiversity, and another 5% will support environmentally-friendly fishing initiatives.', 'The European Union is committed to enhancing energy security through domestically-sourced renewables, including wind energy. However, Germany’ s negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions could undermine these efforts.', 'Negative bidding allows developers to offer to pay the government to build offshore wind farms. This can lead to lower electricity prices for consumers, but it can also put downward pressure on profit margins for companies along the wind energy supply chain. This could discourage investment in new wind energy projects and make it more difficult to achieve the EU’ s renewable energy goals.', 'The German government is urged to reconsider the use of negative bidding in offshore wind energy auctions. Instead, the government should focus on supporting the development of the wind energy supply chain through investments in industrial capacity and infrastructure.', 'Germany plans to tender another 1.8 GW of offshore wind capacity before the end of this year or early 2024 using a different auction design that incorporates a non-price criteria. This is a welcome development according to wind energy experts, as it could help to reduce the unwanted impact of negative bidding on the wind energy supply chain.', 'Klaus Mueller, President of the Federal Network Agency, hailed these zero-cent bids as a positive sign for Germany’ s energy transition, indicating that offshore wind energy is economically viable without subsidies.', ""Raymond Gregory Tribdino is the motoring & information technology editor of Malaya Business Insight ( www.malaya.com.ph) in the Philippines.

One of the most iconic brands in the century-long optimization of automobile engines for sporty driving, with its own tagline being “ The Ultimate Driving Machine, ” BMW has ended the production of combustion engines in its home country of Germany.', 'Germany is one of the leading auto production nations in the world. Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve.', 'Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share.', '“ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports.', 'That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead.', 'Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020.

" How do electric vehicle (EV) sales compare to internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) sales in terms of growth over time?

","['We recently produced several exclusive reports on US electric vehicle sales and overall US auto industry sales trends. Via those reports, you can explore the top automakers or auto brands in terms of their own internal EV share or in terms of their share of the overall EV market, or you can explore growth of the US EV market as a whole, or you can explore trends in auto brand sales broadly, or you can look at trends in EV market share, or you can look at model-by-model EV sales growth. There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what’ s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time.', 'However, one thing I’ ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market. ( To be specific, I’ m referring to the fully electric, or BEV, market here.) Since I’ d already collected all of the core data from automakers over the years, plus a little bit of estimating for brands that lag behind the rest in the data they report ( Tesla included), this wasn’ t a huge challenge — it just required creating a few more rows in my Google Sheet and generating a few more charts. However, I had not thought to do it until requested to by “ Cypress ” under a recent article. What a great suggestion! Why didn’ t I think of that?', 'Well, let’ s just get to the charts and numbers.', 'First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales. Wait, which powertrain is struggling with its sales trends?', 'Dipping back into the big, horrible year of COVID, EV sales were up 356% in 2023 compared to 2020, while ICEV sales were up just slightly, 1%.', 'Going even further back, looking at the pre-COVID numbers of 2019, we can see that EV sales were up 385% in 2023 compared to 2019, while ICEV sales were down 14%.', 'So, of all the ways we’ ve looked at changes in the EV market and changes in the auto market as a whole, I think these comparisons most clearly highlight that EV sales have been growing strongly year after year, whereas the non-EV market needs to worry about what’ s happening and plan accordingly.', 'Thanks to Cypress again for the request/idea for this report.', 'You can also look at these numbers in a slightly different way via the two charts below.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

" What was Tesla's production target for the Cybertruck in a single week a couple of weeks ago, and what does this translate to in terms of annual production?

","['There have been a lot of questions about the Tesla Cybertruck’ s mass-production potential since the truck was first shown, and we’ re clearly in a kind of “ production hell ” period of the Cybertruck ramp-up. Recently, production was paused and a recall issued because of an issue with the accelerator pedal. Nonetheless, Cybertruck production capacity is slowly ramping up.', 'In the Tesla shareholder letter today and then also on the conference call, it was stated that Tesla reached production of 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week a couple of weeks ago. Of course, that just translates to about 52,000 trucks a year, which is far from Tesla’ s target, but they were proud to boast about this new weekly high.', '“ The Cybertruck ramp continued successfully at Gigafactory Texas, with a sequential cost improvement in Q1. We produced over 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week in April, ” Tesla wrote.', 'Of course, Tesla aims to increase production capacity for the Cybertruck throughout the year, but there was no targets communicated for where Tesla wants to be by the end of Q2, by the end of Q3, or by the end of the year. Though, overall Cybertruck “ capacity ” at the company’ s factory in Texas is > 125,000 according to the shareholder letter. In other words, that’ s where they think they can max out production with the equipment currently installed at the gigafactory, and that’ s more than double the Cybertruck’ s current production rate high.', 'Unfortunately, no one asked about issues or limitations currently holding back higher Tesla Cybertruck production rates, so we don’ t know what issues Tesla is grappling with at the moment ( aside from the accelerator pedal recall). Where will Cybertruck production be at the end of this quarter? It’ s anyone’ s guess. It could still be at a high of 1,000/week, it could double to 2,000/week, or perhaps it could even triple to 3,000/week.

" How are Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) affecting the automotive market in Thailand, particularly in terms of pricing and customer behavior?

","['The new AlixPartners report 2024 Global Automotive Outlook has stimulated quite a lot of thoughts and feedback. Steve Hanley kicked things off with his summary of the findings. Reading through that, I couldn’ t help chiming in by pulling out a couple of key highlights and expounding on them. In between, though, a reader contributed what might be the most interesting comment of all. Writing the comment under Steve’ s article, “ UjiBebek ” contributes the following:', 'During a recent trip to Thailand I noticed a significant number of Chinese EVs on the roads. According to data published recently, EVs sales in the first five months of 2024 increased by 31% to 43k units, while total vehicles sales dropped by 24%, down to 260k units.', 'I discussed this topic with a local friend, and I found interesting the impact EVs are having on the automotive market overall. The availability of cheap imports from China has triggered a generalized reduction in the prices of cars in the Kingdom.', 'New cars prices dropped significantly, with price reductions of up to 20% applied by dealers on the MSRP of some vehicles, especially those which are in direct competition against the Chinese imports. And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share. Thailand should soon be at around one out of every five new cars sold being electric, then one out of every four new cars sold being electric, then. …', 'But exponential growth is one thing. Disrupting pricing in the auto market and essentially chasing some companies out of it in the process is something else.', 'Cheap electric cars from China seem to be doing something special in Thailand. I’ m very curious to explore in more detail with local data sources, and even more than that, I’ m curious to see if these kinds of things are happening in other less-talked-about countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

" How can electric vehicle batteries contribute to grid stability, and what is the role of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology in this effort?

","['The bad news just keeps on coming for fossil energy stakeholders. In the latest development, BMW is working with the leading California utility, PG & E, to demonstrate how EV batteries can contribute to grid stability instead of placing new burdens on the nation’ s electricity infrastructure. The secret sauce is V2X, the Vehicle-to-Everything model for using an EV battery to power all sorts of electric devices.', 'BMW is kicking vehicle-to-everything ( V2X) into high gear with an assist from the California utility PG & E. Photo courtesy of BMW.', 'The infrastructure argument against widespread EV adoption has been neatly summed up by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who called zero emission vehicles a “ new way to overburden California’ s already collapsing energy grid ” in a segment last September.', 'Whoa if true. However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity.', 'The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs.', 'On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase.', '“ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America.', 'As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere.', 'Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too.', '“ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains.', 'The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy.', 'So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways. You can generate it with solar, with wind, in a camper, and with hydropower, ” an Army spokesperson said. “ Electricity is going to be the fuel of tomorrow. ”', 'No more Trainwreck Twitter.

" What are the environmental and human rights concerns associated with the global lithium supply chain?

","['More EV battery activity is stirring over at the Hell’ s Kitchen geothermal brine lithium supply project.', 'The race to supply the global auto industry with enough lithium to fuel the switchover from gas to lithium-ion EV batteries is churning into high gear. The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project.', 'Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California.', 'The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain.', 'That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot.', '“ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed.', 'The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ”', 'The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground.', 'Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues.

" Why did the offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico fail to attract bidders, despite billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act?

","['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid. Will offshore wind come to the Gulf in the future? “ We’ ll see, ” said the Zen master.', ""Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him.

" What partnership has been announced to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico, aiming to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers?

","['With all of the EV news coming out of the United States, Canada, China, and Europe, sometimes it’ s easy to forget about some of our neighbors to the south. But that’ s a mistake. Many upcoming EVs for the U.S. market are being built in Mexico, and they need the benefits of electric drive down there just as much as we do. But, for my family down there, it’ s probably going to be a long time before I see them come visit in an EV, both because they’ re difficult to afford and because charging is hard to come by.', 'The same would be true if I wanted to take my Bolt to to visit the little town where my grandmother grew up. Safety issues aside, making the 400-mile round trip isn’ t really feasible, because the whole area is a giant charging dead zone. This is a real shame, because it’ s just a 3–4 hour trip into a neighboring state, and it wouldn’ t be a problem if the states were both on this side of the border. Seeing yet another barrier grow between us all isn’ t great.', 'That’ s why I thought it was great news when a press release came across the desk about a deal to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico. Volvo Cars has partnered with Evergo, a leading charging station platform for electric vehicles in the region, as part of its electrification strategy. This alliance aims to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide Volvo customers in Mexico and Latin America with access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers.', '“ Each of the actions we implement are firm steps that help us connect cities. We not only want to promote our objectives, we begin to make them a reality by offering an infrastructure solution that allows the mobility of users who have opted for an electric car, ” said Raymundo Cavazos, general director of Volvo Car México.', 'More importantly, it’ s no small deal. The collaboration aims to install 2,295 chargers in Mexico over the next 3 years, including 803 DC fast charging stations ( which the press release refers to as “ superchargers ”). The companies say this expansion will enhance range freedom for users by providing greater charging access along major routes, but they did not provide further specifics about locations.', 'But, they did share that 2,213 kilometers of tourist routes will soon connect more parts of the country. Chargers are already installed in the Puebla-San Luis Potosí Corridor, and by the end of 2024, new routes like Mexico City-Acapulco, Guadalajara-Puerto Vallarta, Tijuana-Ensenada, Mérida-Cancún, and Monterrey-McAllen will be connected.', '“ This alliance leads us towards an increasingly promising horizon in terms of electric mobility in Mexico. Through this shared commitment, we ensure that in the short term, a greater number of users can enjoy the benefits of more sustainable mobility, backed by the most advanced technology on the market, and with the necessary confidence to reach the main destinations. of the country without worrying about running out of charge, ” said Daniel López, commercial director of Evergo Mexico.', 'The Evergo and Volvo alliance also extends to Latin America, enabling Volvo users in multiple countries to access the charging network available in Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. The Swedish company also collaborates with VEMO, a cleantech company that integrates the entire clean mobility ecosystem. Together, they have agreed on the installation of 70 chargers in shopping centers and universities.', '“ By 2025 we have a commitment that half of Volvo vehicles will be fully electric. Our mission is to take care of people, future generations and the environment, electrification plays an essential role in achieving this goal, ” added Raymundo Cavazos, CEO of Volvo Car Mexico.', 'Since launching the Volvo XC40 Recharge in 2021, Volvo has provided a charger to each of its electric vehicle customers, resulting in around 800 home charging network chargers across Latin America as well.', 'Finally, the companies said that starting next year, Volvo electric vehicles will be equipped with the NACS-type connector in Mexico just as they will in the United States and Canada, enabling brand users to utilize Tesla’ s chargers across North America. In Mexico, there will be a total of 660 chargers available, including 60 Superchargers, allowing for even more expansion of charging opportunities for Volvo customers.', 'Considering that there are only 60 Supercharger stations in Mexico and a few dozen CCS or CHAdeMO stations, the deal Volvo and Evergo announced will make a big impact. But, at the same time, it’ s not cause for complacency.', 'Economic trade beyond just tourism to the most popular destinations needs to be a priority. And economic trade isn’ t all semi-trucks and big maquiladora plants along the border, either. There are so, so many small businesses and family businesses that depend on going back and forth across the border in smaller vehicles, too.', 'In other words, Mexico is a much more important trading partner than many people realize, in terms of both current reality and in the potential that exists.', 'To watch the United States and Canada embark on a big move to a different model for fueling our transportation systems is great, but we risk losing circulation to our feet and losing them if we don’ t make sure all of our neighbors are making the journey with us. And don’ t take that as any insult to Mexico, because as anybody who lost their feet can tell you, they’ re something you can’ t easily live without.', 'For this reason, we should encourage more automotive manufacturers to expand their charging presence along highways in Mexico. We should also encourage the U.S. and Canadian governments to pitch in and expand charging opportunities the same way they have been doing in their own countries.', 'To many people, the language and cultural barriers may seem insurmountable, and Mexico might seem like some far-off and exotic place, but to many of us, it’ s both family and an essential trading partner.

","['Germany’ s Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA or Federal Network Agency) recently unveiled the outcomes of its largest-ever offshore wind auction, awarding 7 GW of new capacity. This significant achievement marks a substantial milestone in Germany’ s quest for renewable energy expansion and is worth about €12.6 billion or $ 13.96 billion.', 'At the Global Wind Energy Summit in Australia last month, offshore wind experts discussed the landmark auction started in April and completed in the middle of July with cautious excitement. Two of Europe’ s big oil companies, BP and Total Energies, won the bids in the North Sea totaling 6 GW and 1 GW in the Baltic Sea.', 'This September, renewed interest in the German auction came about because of the failure of the UK to secure takers for its own offshore wind projects.', 'But the win of BP and Total was seen differently and the impact of the negative bidding required project developers to essentially pay for the privilege of building their wind farms. While it undoubtedly ensured a cost-effective outcome for the government, the repercussions are far-reaching.', 'As an example, wind energy expert Ørsted chose to exit the German seabed lease auction before its completion this September, a Reuters report said last July. The report also indicated that company executives “ expressed concerns about high prices. ”', 'The negative bidding system inherently transfers additional costs to offshore wind developers, who must now decide where to allocate these expenses. The wind supply chain, which is already grappling with inflation and surging input costs, may find itself further burdened. Alternatively, consumers, who are already contending with rising electricity prices and the overall cost of living, may bear the brunt of this financial burden.', 'The Bundesnetzagentur is steadfast in its model to achieve its ambitious energy targets.', 'The outcome of this auction compels offshore wind developers to foot the staggering €12.6 billion bill to the German Government. Notably, 90% of these funds will be allocated to financing grid connection costs, while 5% will be devoted to protecting maritime biodiversity, and another 5% will support environmentally-friendly fishing initiatives.', 'The European Union is committed to enhancing energy security through domestically-sourced renewables, including wind energy. However, Germany’ s negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions could undermine these efforts.', 'Negative bidding allows developers to offer to pay the government to build offshore wind farms. This can lead to lower electricity prices for consumers, but it can also put downward pressure on profit margins for companies along the wind energy supply chain. This could discourage investment in new wind energy projects and make it more difficult to achieve the EU’ s renewable energy goals.', 'The German government is urged to reconsider the use of negative bidding in offshore wind energy auctions. Instead, the government should focus on supporting the development of the wind energy supply chain through investments in industrial capacity and infrastructure.', 'Germany plans to tender another 1.8 GW of offshore wind capacity before the end of this year or early 2024 using a different auction design that incorporates a non-price criteria. This is a welcome development according to wind energy experts, as it could help to reduce the unwanted impact of negative bidding on the wind energy supply chain.', 'Klaus Mueller, President of the Federal Network Agency, hailed these zero-cent bids as a positive sign for Germany’ s energy transition, indicating that offshore wind energy is economically viable without subsidies.', ""Raymond Gregory Tribdino is the motoring & information technology editor of Malaya Business Insight ( www.malaya.com.ph) in the Philippines.

" What has BMW announced it will do to its workforce and production in Germany due to the end of combustion engine production?

","['It may not be the biggest EV news of the month, but it’ s got to be one of the strongest symbols of the EV transition. One of the most iconic brands in the century-long optimization of automobile engines for sporty driving, with its own tagline being “ The Ultimate Driving Machine, ” BMW has ended the production of combustion engines in its home country of Germany.', 'Germany is one of the leading auto production nations in the world. Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve.', 'Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share.', '“ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports.', 'That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead.', 'Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020. ( It seems the transition could have been completed sooner.) Also, the German phaseout was planned for earlier this year but got delayed.', ""“ The 1,200 employees who previously worked in engine construction will now be retrained and deployed in other areas in future — either at the Munich plant or at other BMW locations. The Works Council expressly welcomed the decision and multi-million euro investment in 2020 and spoke of a ‘ role model for a successfully organised transformation in German industry. ' ”"", 'Without a doubt, as Luke Tonachel of the NRDC just reported in relation to the US and the UAW’ s recent strike, auto industry union workers can see the writing on the wall and don’ t want to be left out of the EV transition. Because if they are, they could be left out in the cold altogether.', 'BMW produces the i4, i5, i7, and iX in Germany. By 2030, one has to think the idea of BMW producing engines in Germany will feel like ancient history, and the company will be manufacturing several more electric vehicle models as well as EV batteries within its borders. For example, BMW’ s hot new Neue Klasse electric vehicles will be produced in Germany starting in 2026.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

" How have EV sales compared to ICEV sales in terms of growth over the past few years?
","['We recently produced several exclusive reports on US electric vehicle sales and overall US auto industry sales trends. Via those reports, you can explore the top automakers or auto brands in terms of their own internal EV share or in terms of their share of the overall EV market, or you can explore growth of the US EV market as a whole, or you can explore trends in auto brand sales broadly, or you can look at trends in EV market share, or you can look at model-by-model EV sales growth. There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what’ s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time.', 'However, one thing I’ ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market. ( To be specific, I’ m referring to the fully electric, or BEV, market here.) Since I’ d already collected all of the core data from automakers over the years, plus a little bit of estimating for brands that lag behind the rest in the data they report ( Tesla included), this wasn’ t a huge challenge — it just required creating a few more rows in my Google Sheet and generating a few more charts. However, I had not thought to do it until requested to by “ Cypress ” under a recent article. What a great suggestion! Why didn’ t I think of that?', 'Well, let’ s just get to the charts and numbers.', 'First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales. Wait, which powertrain is struggling with its sales trends?', 'Dipping back into the big, horrible year of COVID, EV sales were up 356% in 2023 compared to 2020, while ICEV sales were up just slightly, 1%.', 'Going even further back, looking at the pre-COVID numbers of 2019, we can see that EV sales were up 385% in 2023 compared to 2019, while ICEV sales were down 14%.', 'So, of all the ways we’ ve looked at changes in the EV market and changes in the auto market as a whole, I think these comparisons most clearly highlight that EV sales have been growing strongly year after year, whereas the non-EV market needs to worry about what’ s happening and plan accordingly.', 'Thanks to Cypress again for the request/idea for this report.', 'You can also look at these numbers in a slightly different way via the two charts below.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

" What is the current production rate of the Tesla Cybertruck?
","['There have been a lot of questions about the Tesla Cybertruck’ s mass-production potential since the truck was first shown, and we’ re clearly in a kind of “ production hell ” period of the Cybertruck ramp-up. Recently, production was paused and a recall issued because of an issue with the accelerator pedal. Nonetheless, Cybertruck production capacity is slowly ramping up.', 'In the Tesla shareholder letter today and then also on the conference call, it was stated that Tesla reached production of 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week a couple of weeks ago. Of course, that just translates to about 52,000 trucks a year, which is far from Tesla’ s target, but they were proud to boast about this new weekly high.', '“ The Cybertruck ramp continued successfully at Gigafactory Texas, with a sequential cost improvement in Q1. We produced over 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week in April, ” Tesla wrote.', 'Of course, Tesla aims to increase production capacity for the Cybertruck throughout the year, but there was no targets communicated for where Tesla wants to be by the end of Q2, by the end of Q3, or by the end of the year. Though, overall Cybertruck “ capacity ” at the company’ s factory in Texas is > 125,000 according to the shareholder letter. In other words, that’ s where they think they can max out production with the equipment currently installed at the gigafactory, and that’ s more than double the Cybertruck’ s current production rate high.', 'Unfortunately, no one asked about issues or limitations currently holding back higher Tesla Cybertruck production rates, so we don’ t know what issues Tesla is grappling with at the moment ( aside from the accelerator pedal recall). Where will Cybertruck production be at the end of this quarter? It’ s anyone’ s guess. It could still be at a high of 1,000/week, it could double to 2,000/week, or perhaps it could even triple to 3,000/week.

" What is the impact of cheap electric cars from China on the Thai automotive market, and how are they affecting the industry?

","['The new AlixPartners report 2024 Global Automotive Outlook has stimulated quite a lot of thoughts and feedback. Steve Hanley kicked things off with his summary of the findings. Reading through that, I couldn’ t help chiming in by pulling out a couple of key highlights and expounding on them. In between, though, a reader contributed what might be the most interesting comment of all. Writing the comment under Steve’ s article, “ UjiBebek ” contributes the following:', 'During a recent trip to Thailand I noticed a significant number of Chinese EVs on the roads. According to data published recently, EVs sales in the first five months of 2024 increased by 31% to 43k units, while total vehicles sales dropped by 24%, down to 260k units.', 'I discussed this topic with a local friend, and I found interesting the impact EVs are having on the automotive market overall. The availability of cheap imports from China has triggered a generalized reduction in the prices of cars in the Kingdom.', 'New cars prices dropped significantly, with price reductions of up to 20% applied by dealers on the MSRP of some vehicles, especially those which are in direct competition against the Chinese imports. And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share. Thailand should soon be at around one out of every five new cars sold being electric, then one out of every four new cars sold being electric, then. …', 'But exponential growth is one thing. Disrupting pricing in the auto market and essentially chasing some companies out of it in the process is something else.', 'Cheap electric cars from China seem to be doing something special in Thailand. I’ m very curious to explore in more detail with local data sources, and even more than that, I’ m curious to see if these kinds of things are happening in other less-talked-about countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new.

Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase.', '“ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America.', 'As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere.', 'Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too.', '“ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains.', 'The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy.', 'So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways. You can generate it with solar, with wind, in a camper, and with hydropower, ” an Army spokesperson said. “ Electricity is going to be the fuel of tomorrow. ”', 'No more Trainwreck Twitter.

" What is the expected annual production capacity of the new Tesla factory in India?
","['Shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, news is out that it plans a new factory in India.', 'India has surpassed China as the most populous nation in the world. Tesla has a gigafactory in China but none in India. India and China have had a number of disputes over the years, and Indian Prime Minister Modi has told Tesla in no uncertain terms that its Chinese-made automobiles are not welcome in his country. Negotiations have been on again/off again between Tesla and India for several years, with little forward progress being made. India imposes an import duty of up to 100% on vehicles manufactured in other countries.', 'In June, Elon Musk tore himself away from his chores as the owner of T * itter to visit with the Indian prime minister personally in the US, after which he pledged to begin manufacturing Tesla automobiles in India “ as soon as humanly possible. ” And why not? India is now the fourth largest new car market in the world, and yet Tesla — which is committed to promoting the EV revolution in every nation on Earth — has virtually no presence there.', 'After the meeting, Modi tweeted, “ Great meeting you today @ elonmusk! We had multifaceted conversations on issues ranging from energy to spirituality. ” For his part, Musk said he planned to visit India personally next year.', 'Now just a few weeks later, Reuters reports that Tesla is ready to invest in India by building a factory there that would have an annual production capacity of half a million vehicles. The report was first published by the Times of India and cited government sources. Those sources also claim that Tesla intends to use the factory in India as an export base to ship cars to other Asian countries.', 'A team from Tesla went to India in May for preliminary discussions with officials in that country about what incentives might be offered by the government for automobile and battery manufacturing, according to Reuters.', '“ Tesla has come to us with an ambitious plan and we are confident the movement will be positive this time around, especially as it involves both local manufacturing and exports, ” sources said. In fact it appears Tesla intends to start by exporting cars first in order to accurately measure the demand in Asian markets.', 'Building a new Tesla factory in India is good news, but here’ s the real meat in the stew: According to insiders with knowledge of the talks that have been going on since May, the starting price of the vehicles manufactured in India will be 2 million rupees, which translates at today’ s exchange rate to $ 24,401. Tesla does not currently offer a car at the price, so it is unclear at the moment what vehicle Tesla has in mind.', 'There have been rumors and vague statements floating around for a year of more about a so-called Model 2 or Model C or call it what you want that will sell for less that $ 25,000. Although, Tesla has been very tightlipped about how far along such a vehicle is, and when exactly it may find its way into production. Some observers think the new factory in Mexico will be the first to build such a car, and that it could do so next year. If that’ s the case, what about India too?', 'By the way, if that price seems low, there are several electric cars available to customers in India that are less expensive. The MG Comet sells for around $ 12,000 and the Tata Nexon EV lists for around $ 18,000. At the present time, the Tata is the best selling electric car in the country.', 'The Indian commerce and industry ministry is leading the talks with Tesla and hopes to put together a “ good deal ” while maintaining a level playing field, as talks now involve both local manufacturing and exports, according to local media sources.', 'As we reported last month, prime minister Modi was a staunch advocate for electric vehicles a few years ago. He even claiming that India would be the first country to reach 100% electric vehicles. Since those grand pronouncements, India hasn’ t done much to actually stimulate a lot of EV adoption. Perhaps things are changing, though.', 'Indian manufacturing powerhouse Tata Group is now making a big move into the space, reportedly investing 130 billion rupees ( $ 1.58 billion) into a lithium-ion battery cell factory in the country. At the moment, only 1% of Indian auto sales are EV sales, but Tata Motors is the leader in the sector.', 'That battery factory won’ t be coming online any time soon, however. Construction is scheduled to begin sometime in next 3 years. It is slated to have an annual production capacity of 20 GWh, with the possibility of increasing that to 40 GWh in a few years. The Tata battery factory will be located in Sanand, in northern Gujarat.', 'There was big news about battery raw materials in India recently. A large supply of lithium — almost 6 million tons — has been discovered in the states of Jammu & Kashmir, and the government is expected to begin auctioning off the mining rights to those reserves later this year.', 'The reserves, confirmed earlier this year, have placed India among the top five countries for lithium reserves in the world. The reserves are said to have a high purity and are graded at 500 parts per million compared to the normal grade of 220 parts per million.', 'India’ s minister for transportation has expressed optimism about the country’ s improved prospects as an EV powerhouse following conformation of the reserves’ purity and leading to claims that India could become the largest EV manufacturer in the world using them. The Indian government aims to achieve a 30% share of electric vehicles in private cars, 70% in commercial vehicles, and 80% in two- and three-wheeled vehicles by 2030.', 'India may be the largest country by population, but it lags far behind other large countries in terms of manufacturing prowess. By opening the door to Tesla, it could begin the transfer of technical skills it needs to become one of the world’ s leading economies. One thing we can be fairly certain of is that it won’ t take Tesla three years to get a factory built and into production.', 'This is a win/win for Tesla and India, the proverbial match made in heaven. We can’ t wait to find out what sort of vehicle the company plans to manufacture there and whether it will arrive one day in the US, where prospective EV purchasers are waiting anxiously for cars that are affordable.', ""Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him.

" What was the percentage growth in Volkswagen Group's overall vehicle deliveries for the first half of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022?

","['Volkswagen Group’ s electric transition is continuing at a good pace. Its pure electric ( BEV) sales were up nearly 50% in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2022. They grew from 217,200 to 321,600. Furthermore, there are another 200,000 or so BEV orders on the books just in Western Europe.', 'Reaching 321,600 deliveries in the first half of the year, that was 7.4% of Volkswagen Group’ s overall vehicle deliveries. That’ s an increase from the company’ s 5.6% figure for the first half of 2022.', 'While Tesla is known to be the world leader in BEV sales ( and # 2 behind BYD in plugin vehicle sales), Volkswagen Group is actually # 1 in BEV sales in Europe. Furthermore, the company’ s sales growth in Europe even surpassed its sales growth worldwide. Sales grew from 128,900 in the first half of 2022 to 217,100 in the first half of 2023, which is 68% growth ( compared to 50% growth worldwide).', 'Additionally, the recent trend and expected trend going forward is even stronger than at the beginning of the year. “ With an increase in all-electric deliveries of around 50 percent in the first half of the year, the Volkswagen Group is systematically continuing its transformation, ” Hildegard Wortmann, member of Volkswagen Group’ s Extended Executive Committee for Sales, says. “ Since May, we have again seen an improved trend in incoming orders here, after a certain reluctance on the part of our customers at the start of the year due to reduced subsidy programs, partly long waiting times and high inflation. In view of the recent significant reduction in delivery times, we expect this positive trend to continue in the coming months. ”', 'The USA is coming through with big growth as well. Volkswagen Group reached 29,800 sales there, a 79% increase over the previous year.', 'However, there’ s one stain on the company’ s jacket. Deliveries were 2% lower in China, totaling 62,400. But Volkswagen Group brought out some positive news from there nonetheless — it did see 18% growth in BEV sales in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. So, we can say that the numbers are still rising fast there.', 'Looking at the second quarter more broadly — worldwide — deliveries were up 53%, from 118,000 in the second quarter of 2022 to 180,600 in the second quarter of 2023.', 'Volkswagen Group’ s BEV sales are dominated by sales in Europe, and then almost all of the rest of sales are in China and the USA. Europe accounts for 68% of sales, China 19%, and the USA 9%. That leaves 4% for the result of the world.', 'What about the brand split? There are approximately 100 auto brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella, right? ( Maybe not 100.) Volkswagen accounted for a little more than half of the auto group’ s BEV sales ( 164,800 vehicles), Audi accounted for 24% ( 75,600 vehicles), ŠKODA accounted for 10% ( 31,300 vehicles), SEAT/CUPRA accounted for 6% ( 18,900 vehicles), Porsche accounted for 6% ( 18,900 vehicles), and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles accounted for 4% ( 12,300 vehicles).', 'You can find more Volkswagen Group sales numbers or corporate commentary here.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

" What is the Hell's Kitchen lithium project in California, and what company has invested $100 million in it to boost the global supply of lithium for electric vehicles?

","['More EV battery activity is stirring over at the Hell’ s Kitchen geothermal brine lithium supply project.', 'The race to supply the global auto industry with enough lithium to fuel the switchover from gas to lithium-ion EV batteries is churning into high gear. The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project.', 'Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California.', 'The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain.', 'That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot.', '“ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed.', 'The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ”', 'The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground.', 'Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues.

" What were some of the reasons why the offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico failed to attract bidders during the recent BOEM auction?

","['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day.

" Why is it important to have a robust network of electric vehicle charging stations in Mexico, particularly along highways, to support growing demand and facilitate economic trade with neighboring countries?

","['With all of the EV news coming out of the United States, Canada, China, and Europe, sometimes it’ s easy to forget about some of our neighbors to the south. But that’ s a mistake. Many upcoming EVs for the U.S. market are being built in Mexico, and they need the benefits of electric drive down there just as much as we do. But, for my family down there, it’ s probably going to be a long time before I see them come visit in an EV, both because they’ re difficult to afford and because charging is hard to come by.', 'The same would be true if I wanted to take my Bolt to to visit the little town where my grandmother grew up. Safety issues aside, making the 400-mile round trip isn’ t really feasible, because the whole area is a giant charging dead zone. This is a real shame, because it’ s just a 3–4 hour trip into a neighboring state, and it wouldn’ t be a problem if the states were both on this side of the border. Seeing yet another barrier grow between us all isn’ t great.', 'That’ s why I thought it was great news when a press release came across the desk about a deal to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico. Volvo Cars has partnered with Evergo, a leading charging station platform for electric vehicles in the region, as part of its electrification strategy. This alliance aims to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide Volvo customers in Mexico and Latin America with access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers.', '“ Each of the actions we implement are firm steps that help us connect cities. We not only want to promote our objectives, we begin to make them a reality by offering an infrastructure solution that allows the mobility of users who have opted for an electric car, ” said Raymundo Cavazos, general director of Volvo Car México.', 'More importantly, it’ s no small deal. The collaboration aims to install 2,295 chargers in Mexico over the next 3 years, including 803 DC fast charging stations ( which the press release refers to as “ superchargers ”). The companies say this expansion will enhance range freedom for users by providing greater charging access along major routes, but they did not provide further specifics about locations.', 'But, they did share that 2,213 kilometers of tourist routes will soon connect more parts of the country. Chargers are already installed in the Puebla-San Luis Potosí Corridor, and by the end of 2024, new routes like Mexico City-Acapulco, Guadalajara-Puerto Vallarta, Tijuana-Ensenada, Mérida-Cancún, and Monterrey-McAllen will be connected.', '“ This alliance leads us towards an increasingly promising horizon in terms of electric mobility in Mexico. Through this shared commitment, we ensure that in the short term, a greater number of users can enjoy the benefits of more sustainable mobility, backed by the most advanced technology on the market, and with the necessary confidence to reach the main destinations. of the country without worrying about running out of charge, ” said Daniel López, commercial director of Evergo Mexico.', 'The Evergo and Volvo alliance also extends to Latin America, enabling Volvo users in multiple countries to access the charging network available in Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. The Swedish company also collaborates with VEMO, a cleantech company that integrates the entire clean mobility ecosystem. Together, they have agreed on the installation of 70 chargers in shopping centers and universities.', '“ By 2025 we have a commitment that half of Volvo vehicles will be fully electric. Our mission is to take care of people, future generations and the environment, electrification plays an essential role in achieving this goal, ” added Raymundo Cavazos, CEO of Volvo Car Mexico.', 'Since launching the Volvo XC40 Recharge in 2021, Volvo has provided a charger to each of its electric vehicle customers, resulting in around 800 home charging network chargers across Latin America as well.', 'Finally, the companies said that starting next year, Volvo electric vehicles will be equipped with the NACS-type connector in Mexico just as they will in the United States and Canada, enabling brand users to utilize Tesla’ s chargers across North America. In Mexico, there will be a total of 660 chargers available, including 60 Superchargers, allowing for even more expansion of charging opportunities for Volvo customers.', 'Considering that there are only 60 Supercharger stations in Mexico and a few dozen CCS or CHAdeMO stations, the deal Volvo and Evergo announced will make a big impact. But, at the same time, it’ s not cause for complacency.', 'Economic trade beyond just tourism to the most popular destinations needs to be a priority. And economic trade isn’ t all semi-trucks and big maquiladora plants along the border, either. There are so, so many small businesses and family businesses that depend on going back and forth across the border in smaller vehicles, too.', 'In other words, Mexico is a much more important trading partner than many people realize, in terms of both current reality and in the potential that exists.', 'To watch the United States and Canada embark on a big move to a different model for fueling our transportation systems is great, but we risk losing circulation to our feet and losing them if we don’ t make sure all of our neighbors are making the journey with us. And don’ t take that as any insult to Mexico, because as anybody who lost their feet can tell you, they’ re something you can’ t easily live without.', 'For this reason, we should encourage more automotive manufacturers to expand their charging presence along highways in Mexico. We should also encourage the U.S. and Canadian governments to pitch in and expand charging opportunities the same way they have been doing in their own countries.', 'To many people, the language and cultural barriers may seem insurmountable, and Mexico might seem like some far-off and exotic place, but to many of us, it’ s both family and an essential trading partner.

","['Germany’ s Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA or Federal Network Agency) recently unveiled the outcomes of its largest-ever offshore wind auction, awarding 7 GW of new capacity. This significant achievement marks a substantial milestone in Germany’ s quest for renewable energy expansion and is worth about €12.6 billion or $ 13.96 billion.', 'At the Global Wind Energy Summit in Australia last month, offshore wind experts discussed the landmark auction started in April and completed in the middle of July with cautious excitement. Two of Europe’ s big oil companies, BP and Total Energies, won the bids in the North Sea totaling 6 GW and 1 GW in the Baltic Sea.', 'This September, renewed interest in the German auction came about because of the failure of the UK to secure takers for its own offshore wind projects.', 'But the win of BP and Total was seen differently and the impact of the negative bidding required project developers to essentially pay for the privilege of building their wind farms. While it undoubtedly ensured a cost-effective outcome for the government, the repercussions are far-reaching.', 'As an example, wind energy expert Ørsted chose to exit the German seabed lease auction before its completion this September, a Reuters report said last July. The report also indicated that company executives “ expressed concerns about high prices. ”', 'The negative bidding system inherently transfers additional costs to offshore wind developers, who must now decide where to allocate these expenses. The wind supply chain, which is already grappling with inflation and surging input costs, may find itself further burdened. Alternatively, consumers, who are already contending with rising electricity prices and the overall cost of living, may bear the brunt of this financial burden.', 'The Bundesnetzagentur is steadfast in its model to achieve its ambitious energy targets.', 'The outcome of this auction compels offshore wind developers to foot the staggering €12.6 billion bill to the German Government. Notably, 90% of these funds will be allocated to financing grid connection costs, while 5% will be devoted to protecting maritime biodiversity, and another 5% will support environmentally-friendly fishing initiatives.', 'The European Union is committed to enhancing energy security through domestically-sourced renewables, including wind energy. However, Germany’ s negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions could undermine these efforts.', 'Negative bidding allows developers to offer to pay the government to build offshore wind farms. This can lead to lower electricity prices for consumers, but it can also put downward pressure on profit margins for companies along the wind energy supply chain. This could discourage investment in new wind energy projects and make it more difficult to achieve the EU’ s renewable energy goals.', 'The German government is urged to reconsider the use of negative bidding in offshore wind energy auctions. Instead, the government should focus on supporting the development of the wind energy supply chain through investments in industrial capacity and infrastructure.', 'Germany plans to tender another 1.8 GW of offshore wind capacity before the end of this year or early 2024 using a different auction design that incorporates a non-price criteria. This is a welcome development according to wind energy experts, as it could help to reduce the unwanted impact of negative bidding on the wind energy supply chain.', 'Klaus Mueller, President of the Federal Network Agency, hailed these zero-cent bids as a positive sign for Germany’ s energy transition, indicating that offshore wind energy is economically viable without subsidies.', ""Raymond Gregory Tribdino is the motoring & information technology editor of Malaya Business Insight ( www.malaya.com.ph) in the Philippines.

Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve.', 'Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share.', '“ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports.', 'That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead.', 'Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020.

There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what’ s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time.', 'However, one thing I’ ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market.

Since I’ d already collected all of the core data from automakers over the years, plus a little bit of estimating for brands that lag behind the rest in the data they report ( Tesla included), this wasn’ t a huge challenge — it just required creating a few more rows in my Google Sheet and generating a few more charts. However, I had not thought to do it until requested to by “ Cypress ” under a recent article. What a great suggestion! Why didn’ t I think of that?', 'Well, let’ s just get to the charts and numbers.', 'First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales. Wait, which powertrain is struggling with its sales trends?', 'Dipping back into the big, horrible year of COVID, EV sales were up 356% in 2023 compared to 2020, while ICEV sales were up just slightly, 1%.', 'Going even further back, looking at the pre-COVID numbers of 2019, we can see that EV sales were up 385% in 2023 compared to 2019, while ICEV sales were down 14%.', 'So, of all the ways we’ ve looked at changes in the EV market and changes in the auto market as a whole, I think these comparisons most clearly highlight that EV sales have been growing strongly year after year, whereas the non-EV market needs to worry about what’ s happening and plan accordingly.', 'Thanks to Cypress again for the request/idea for this report.', 'You can also look at these numbers in a slightly different way via the two charts below.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

Reading through that, I couldn’ t help chiming in by pulling out a couple of key highlights and expounding on them. In between, though, a reader contributed what might be the most interesting comment of all. Writing the comment under Steve’ s article, “ UjiBebek ” contributes the following:', 'During a recent trip to Thailand I noticed a significant number of Chinese EVs on the roads. According to data published recently, EVs sales in the first five months of 2024 increased by 31% to 43k units, while total vehicles sales dropped by 24%, down to 260k units.', 'I discussed this topic with a local friend, and I found interesting the impact EVs are having on the automotive market overall. The availability of cheap imports from China has triggered a generalized reduction in the prices of cars in the Kingdom.', 'New cars prices dropped significantly, with price reductions of up to 20% applied by dealers on the MSRP of some vehicles, especially those which are in direct competition against the Chinese imports. And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share.

" How can Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries contribute to grid stability and provide a more efficient use of renewable energy through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology?

","['The bad news just keeps on coming for fossil energy stakeholders. In the latest development, BMW is working with the leading California utility, PG & E, to demonstrate how EV batteries can contribute to grid stability instead of placing new burdens on the nation’ s electricity infrastructure. The secret sauce is V2X, the Vehicle-to-Everything model for using an EV battery to power all sorts of electric devices.', 'BMW is kicking vehicle-to-everything ( V2X) into high gear with an assist from the California utility PG & E. Photo courtesy of BMW.', 'The infrastructure argument against widespread EV adoption has been neatly summed up by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who called zero emission vehicles a “ new way to overburden California’ s already collapsing energy grid ” in a segment last September.', 'Whoa if true. However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity.', 'The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs.', 'On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase.', '“ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America.', 'As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere.', 'Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too.', '“ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains.', 'The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy.', 'So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways. You can generate it with solar, with wind, in a camper, and with hydropower, ” an Army spokesperson said. “ Electricity is going to be the fuel of tomorrow. ”', 'No more Trainwreck Twitter.

","['Shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, news is out that it plans a new factory in India.', 'India has surpassed China as the most populous nation in the world. Tesla has a gigafactory in China but none in India. India and China have had a number of disputes over the years, and Indian Prime Minister Modi has told Tesla in no uncertain terms that its Chinese-made automobiles are not welcome in his country. Negotiations have been on again/off again between Tesla and India for several years, with little forward progress being made. India imposes an import duty of up to 100% on vehicles manufactured in other countries.', 'In June, Elon Musk tore himself away from his chores as the owner of T * itter to visit with the Indian prime minister personally in the US, after which he pledged to begin manufacturing Tesla automobiles in India “ as soon as humanly possible. ” And why not? India is now the fourth largest new car market in the world, and yet Tesla — which is committed to promoting the EV revolution in every nation on Earth — has virtually no presence there.', 'After the meeting, Modi tweeted, “ Great meeting you today @ elonmusk! We had multifaceted conversations on issues ranging from energy to spirituality. ” For his part, Musk said he planned to visit India personally next year.', 'Now just a few weeks later, Reuters reports that Tesla is ready to invest in India by building a factory there that would have an annual production capacity of half a million vehicles. The report was first published by the Times of India and cited government sources. Those sources also claim that Tesla intends to use the factory in India as an export base to ship cars to other Asian countries.', 'A team from Tesla went to India in May for preliminary discussions with officials in that country about what incentives might be offered by the government for automobile and battery manufacturing, according to Reuters.', '“ Tesla has come to us with an ambitious plan and we are confident the movement will be positive this time around, especially as it involves both local manufacturing and exports, ” sources said. In fact it appears Tesla intends to start by exporting cars first in order to accurately measure the demand in Asian markets.', 'Building a new Tesla factory in India is good news, but here’ s the real meat in the stew: According to insiders with knowledge of the talks that have been going on since May, the starting price of the vehicles manufactured in India will be 2 million rupees, which translates at today’ s exchange rate to $ 24,401. Tesla does not currently offer a car at the price, so it is unclear at the moment what vehicle Tesla has in mind.', 'There have been rumors and vague statements floating around for a year of more about a so-called Model 2 or Model C or call it what you want that will sell for less that $ 25,000. Although, Tesla has been very tightlipped about how far along such a vehicle is, and when exactly it may find its way into production. Some observers think the new factory in Mexico will be the first to build such a car, and that it could do so next year. If that’ s the case, what about India too?', 'By the way, if that price seems low, there are several electric cars available to customers in India that are less expensive. The MG Comet sells for around $ 12,000 and the Tata Nexon EV lists for around $ 18,000. At the present time, the Tata is the best selling electric car in the country.', 'The Indian commerce and industry ministry is leading the talks with Tesla and hopes to put together a “ good deal ” while maintaining a level playing field, as talks now involve both local manufacturing and exports, according to local media sources.', 'As we reported last month, prime minister Modi was a staunch advocate for electric vehicles a few years ago. He even claiming that India would be the first country to reach 100% electric vehicles. Since those grand pronouncements, India hasn’ t done much to actually stimulate a lot of EV adoption. Perhaps things are changing, though.', 'Indian manufacturing powerhouse Tata Group is now making a big move into the space, reportedly investing 130 billion rupees ( $ 1.58 billion) into a lithium-ion battery cell factory in the country. At the moment, only 1% of Indian auto sales are EV sales, but Tata Motors is the leader in the sector.', 'That battery factory won’ t be coming online any time soon, however. Construction is scheduled to begin sometime in next 3 years. It is slated to have an annual production capacity of 20 GWh, with the possibility of increasing that to 40 GWh in a few years. The Tata battery factory will be located in Sanand, in northern Gujarat.', 'There was big news about battery raw materials in India recently. A large supply of lithium — almost 6 million tons — has been discovered in the states of Jammu & Kashmir, and the government is expected to begin auctioning off the mining rights to those reserves later this year.', 'The reserves, confirmed earlier this year, have placed India among the top five countries for lithium reserves in the world. The reserves are said to have a high purity and are graded at 500 parts per million compared to the normal grade of 220 parts per million.', 'India’ s minister for transportation has expressed optimism about the country’ s improved prospects as an EV powerhouse following conformation of the reserves’ purity and leading to claims that India could become the largest EV manufacturer in the world using them. The Indian government aims to achieve a 30% share of electric vehicles in private cars, 70% in commercial vehicles, and 80% in two- and three-wheeled vehicles by 2030.', 'India may be the largest country by population, but it lags far behind other large countries in terms of manufacturing prowess. By opening the door to Tesla, it could begin the transfer of technical skills it needs to become one of the world’ s leading economies. One thing we can be fairly certain of is that it won’ t take Tesla three years to get a factory built and into production.', 'This is a win/win for Tesla and India, the proverbial match made in heaven.

" Is the lithium supply chain facing a renewed focus on sustainable and lower-impact extraction technologies to address environmental and social concerns?

","['More EV battery activity is stirring over at the Hell’ s Kitchen geothermal brine lithium supply project.', 'The race to supply the global auto industry with enough lithium to fuel the switchover from gas to lithium-ion EV batteries is churning into high gear. The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project.', 'Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California.', 'The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain.', 'That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot.', '“ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed.', 'The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ”', 'The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground.', 'Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues.

" What were the main challenges and concerns facing the offshore wind industry in the Gulf of Mexico after the failed auction?

","['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid. Will offshore wind come to the Gulf in the future? “ We’ ll see, ” said the Zen master.', ""Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him.

" How many charging stations are planned to be installed in Mexico as part of the partnership between Volvo Cars and Evergo?

","['With all of the EV news coming out of the United States, Canada, China, and Europe, sometimes it’ s easy to forget about some of our neighbors to the south. But that’ s a mistake. Many upcoming EVs for the U.S. market are being built in Mexico, and they need the benefits of electric drive down there just as much as we do. But, for my family down there, it’ s probably going to be a long time before I see them come visit in an EV, both because they’ re difficult to afford and because charging is hard to come by.', 'The same would be true if I wanted to take my Bolt to to visit the little town where my grandmother grew up. Safety issues aside, making the 400-mile round trip isn’ t really feasible, because the whole area is a giant charging dead zone. This is a real shame, because it’ s just a 3–4 hour trip into a neighboring state, and it wouldn’ t be a problem if the states were both on this side of the border. Seeing yet another barrier grow between us all isn’ t great.', 'That’ s why I thought it was great news when a press release came across the desk about a deal to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico. Volvo Cars has partnered with Evergo, a leading charging station platform for electric vehicles in the region, as part of its electrification strategy. This alliance aims to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide Volvo customers in Mexico and Latin America with access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers.', '“ Each of the actions we implement are firm steps that help us connect cities. We not only want to promote our objectives, we begin to make them a reality by offering an infrastructure solution that allows the mobility of users who have opted for an electric car, ” said Raymundo Cavazos, general director of Volvo Car México.', 'More importantly, it’ s no small deal. The collaboration aims to install 2,295 chargers in Mexico over the next 3 years, including 803 DC fast charging stations ( which the press release refers to as “ superchargers ”). The companies say this expansion will enhance range freedom for users by providing greater charging access along major routes, but they did not provide further specifics about locations.', 'But, they did share that 2,213 kilometers of tourist routes will soon connect more parts of the country. Chargers are already installed in the Puebla-San Luis Potosí Corridor, and by the end of 2024, new routes like Mexico City-Acapulco, Guadalajara-Puerto Vallarta, Tijuana-Ensenada, Mérida-Cancún, and Monterrey-McAllen will be connected.', '“ This alliance leads us towards an increasingly promising horizon in terms of electric mobility in Mexico. Through this shared commitment, we ensure that in the short term, a greater number of users can enjoy the benefits of more sustainable mobility, backed by the most advanced technology on the market, and with the necessary confidence to reach the main destinations. of the country without worrying about running out of charge, ” said Daniel López, commercial director of Evergo Mexico.', 'The Evergo and Volvo alliance also extends to Latin America, enabling Volvo users in multiple countries to access the charging network available in Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. The Swedish company also collaborates with VEMO, a cleantech company that integrates the entire clean mobility ecosystem. Together, they have agreed on the installation of 70 chargers in shopping centers and universities.', '“ By 2025 we have a commitment that half of Volvo vehicles will be fully electric. Our mission is to take care of people, future generations and the environment, electrification plays an essential role in achieving this goal, ” added Raymundo Cavazos, CEO of Volvo Car Mexico.', 'Since launching the Volvo XC40 Recharge in 2021, Volvo has provided a charger to each of its electric vehicle customers, resulting in around 800 home charging network chargers across Latin America as well.', 'Finally, the companies said that starting next year, Volvo electric vehicles will be equipped with the NACS-type connector in Mexico just as they will in the United States and Canada, enabling brand users to utilize Tesla’ s chargers across North America. In Mexico, there will be a total of 660 chargers available, including 60 Superchargers, allowing for even more expansion of charging opportunities for Volvo customers.', 'Considering that there are only 60 Supercharger stations in Mexico and a few dozen CCS or CHAdeMO stations, the deal Volvo and Evergo announced will make a big impact. But, at the same time, it’ s not cause for complacency.', 'Economic trade beyond just tourism to the most popular destinations needs to be a priority. And economic trade isn’ t all semi-trucks and big maquiladora plants along the border, either. There are so, so many small businesses and family businesses that depend on going back and forth across the border in smaller vehicles, too.', 'In other words, Mexico is a much more important trading partner than many people realize, in terms of both current reality and in the potential that exists.', 'To watch the United States and Canada embark on a big move to a different model for fueling our transportation systems is great, but we risk losing circulation to our feet and losing them if we don’ t make sure all of our neighbors are making the journey with us. And don’ t take that as any insult to Mexico, because as anybody who lost their feet can tell you, they’ re something you can’ t easily live without.', 'For this reason, we should encourage more automotive manufacturers to expand their charging presence along highways in Mexico. We should also encourage the U.S. and Canadian governments to pitch in and expand charging opportunities the same way they have been doing in their own countries.', 'To many people, the language and cultural barriers may seem insurmountable, and Mexico might seem like some far-off and exotic place, but to many of us, it’ s both family and an essential trading partner.

","['Germany’ s Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA or Federal Network Agency) recently unveiled the outcomes of its largest-ever offshore wind auction, awarding 7 GW of new capacity. This significant achievement marks a substantial milestone in Germany’ s quest for renewable energy expansion and is worth about €12.6 billion or $ 13.96 billion.', 'At the Global Wind Energy Summit in Australia last month, offshore wind experts discussed the landmark auction started in April and completed in the middle of July with cautious excitement. Two of Europe’ s big oil companies, BP and Total Energies, won the bids in the North Sea totaling 6 GW and 1 GW in the Baltic Sea.', 'This September, renewed interest in the German auction came about because of the failure of the UK to secure takers for its own offshore wind projects.', 'But the win of BP and Total was seen differently and the impact of the negative bidding required project developers to essentially pay for the privilege of building their wind farms. While it undoubtedly ensured a cost-effective outcome for the government, the repercussions are far-reaching.', 'As an example, wind energy expert Ørsted chose to exit the German seabed lease auction before its completion this September, a Reuters report said last July. The report also indicated that company executives “ expressed concerns about high prices. ”', 'The negative bidding system inherently transfers additional costs to offshore wind developers, who must now decide where to allocate these expenses. The wind supply chain, which is already grappling with inflation and surging input costs, may find itself further burdened. Alternatively, consumers, who are already contending with rising electricity prices and the overall cost of living, may bear the brunt of this financial burden.', 'The Bundesnetzagentur is steadfast in its model to achieve its ambitious energy targets.', 'The outcome of this auction compels offshore wind developers to foot the staggering €12.6 billion bill to the German Government. Notably, 90% of these funds will be allocated to financing grid connection costs, while 5% will be devoted to protecting maritime biodiversity, and another 5% will support environmentally-friendly fishing initiatives.', 'The European Union is committed to enhancing energy security through domestically-sourced renewables, including wind energy. However, Germany’ s negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions could undermine these efforts.', 'Negative bidding allows developers to offer to pay the government to build offshore wind farms. This can lead to lower electricity prices for consumers, but it can also put downward pressure on profit margins for companies along the wind energy supply chain. This could discourage investment in new wind energy projects and make it more difficult to achieve the EU’ s renewable energy goals.', 'The German government is urged to reconsider the use of negative bidding in offshore wind energy auctions. Instead, the government should focus on supporting the development of the wind energy supply chain through investments in industrial capacity and infrastructure.', 'Germany plans to tender another 1.8 GW of offshore wind capacity before the end of this year or early 2024 using a different auction design that incorporates a non-price criteria.

" Is BMW's decision to end production of combustion engines in its German home country a significant indicator of the rapid transition to electric vehicles in the automotive industry?

","['It may not be the biggest EV news of the month, but it’ s got to be one of the strongest symbols of the EV transition. One of the most iconic brands in the century-long optimization of automobile engines for sporty driving, with its own tagline being “ The Ultimate Driving Machine, ” BMW has ended the production of combustion engines in its home country of Germany.', 'Germany is one of the leading auto production nations in the world. Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve.', 'Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share.', '“ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports.', 'That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead.', 'Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020. ( It seems the transition could have been completed sooner.) Also, the German phaseout was planned for earlier this year but got delayed.', ""“ The 1,200 employees who previously worked in engine construction will now be retrained and deployed in other areas in future — either at the Munich plant or at other BMW locations. The Works Council expressly welcomed the decision and multi-million euro investment in 2020 and spoke of a ‘ role model for a successfully organised transformation in German industry. ' ”"", 'Without a doubt, as Luke Tonachel of the NRDC just reported in relation to the US and the UAW’ s recent strike, auto industry union workers can see the writing on the wall and don’ t want to be left out of the EV transition. Because if they are, they could be left out in the cold altogether.', 'BMW produces the i4, i5, i7, and iX in Germany. By 2030, one has to think the idea of BMW producing engines in Germany will feel like ancient history, and the company will be manufacturing several more electric vehicle models as well as EV batteries within its borders.

" How has the EV market compared to the ICEV market in terms of sales growth over the past few years?

","['We recently produced several exclusive reports on US electric vehicle sales and overall US auto industry sales trends. Via those reports, you can explore the top automakers or auto brands in terms of their own internal EV share or in terms of their share of the overall EV market, or you can explore growth of the US EV market as a whole, or you can explore trends in auto brand sales broadly, or you can look at trends in EV market share, or you can look at model-by-model EV sales growth. There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what’ s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time.', 'However, one thing I’ ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market. ( To be specific, I’ m referring to the fully electric, or BEV, market here.) Since I’ d already collected all of the core data from automakers over the years, plus a little bit of estimating for brands that lag behind the rest in the data they report ( Tesla included), this wasn’ t a huge challenge — it just required creating a few more rows in my Google Sheet and generating a few more charts. However, I had not thought to do it until requested to by “ Cypress ” under a recent article. What a great suggestion! Why didn’ t I think of that?', 'Well, let’ s just get to the charts and numbers.', 'First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales. Wait, which powertrain is struggling with its sales trends?', 'Dipping back into the big, horrible year of COVID, EV sales were up 356% in 2023 compared to 2020, while ICEV sales were up just slightly, 1%.', 'Going even further back, looking at the pre-COVID numbers of 2019, we can see that EV sales were up 385% in 2023 compared to 2019, while ICEV sales were down 14%.', 'So, of all the ways we’ ve looked at changes in the EV market and changes in the auto market as a whole, I think these comparisons most clearly highlight that EV sales have been growing strongly year after year, whereas the non-EV market needs to worry about what’ s happening and plan accordingly.', 'Thanks to Cypress again for the request/idea for this report.', 'You can also look at these numbers in a slightly different way via the two charts below.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

" What is the current production capacity of the Tesla Cybertruck at the Gigafactory in Texas?
","['There have been a lot of questions about the Tesla Cybertruck’ s mass-production potential since the truck was first shown, and we’ re clearly in a kind of “ production hell ” period of the Cybertruck ramp-up. Recently, production was paused and a recall issued because of an issue with the accelerator pedal. Nonetheless, Cybertruck production capacity is slowly ramping up.', 'In the Tesla shareholder letter today and then also on the conference call, it was stated that Tesla reached production of 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week a couple of weeks ago. Of course, that just translates to about 52,000 trucks a year, which is far from Tesla’ s target, but they were proud to boast about this new weekly high.', '“ The Cybertruck ramp continued successfully at Gigafactory Texas, with a sequential cost improvement in Q1. We produced over 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week in April, ” Tesla wrote.', 'Of course, Tesla aims to increase production capacity for the Cybertruck throughout the year, but there was no targets communicated for where Tesla wants to be by the end of Q2, by the end of Q3, or by the end of the year. Though, overall Cybertruck “ capacity ” at the company’ s factory in Texas is > 125,000 according to the shareholder letter. In other words, that’ s where they think they can max out production with the equipment currently installed at the gigafactory, and that’ s more than double the Cybertruck’ s current production rate high.', 'Unfortunately, no one asked about issues or limitations currently holding back higher Tesla Cybertruck production rates, so we don’ t know what issues Tesla is grappling with at the moment ( aside from the accelerator pedal recall). Where will Cybertruck production be at the end of this quarter? It’ s anyone’ s guess. It could still be at a high of 1,000/week, it could double to 2,000/week, or perhaps it could even triple to 3,000/week.

" How are Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) affecting the automotive market in Thailand?

","['The new AlixPartners report 2024 Global Automotive Outlook has stimulated quite a lot of thoughts and feedback. Steve Hanley kicked things off with his summary of the findings. Reading through that, I couldn’ t help chiming in by pulling out a couple of key highlights and expounding on them. In between, though, a reader contributed what might be the most interesting comment of all. Writing the comment under Steve’ s article, “ UjiBebek ” contributes the following:', 'During a recent trip to Thailand I noticed a significant number of Chinese EVs on the roads. According to data published recently, EVs sales in the first five months of 2024 increased by 31% to 43k units, while total vehicles sales dropped by 24%, down to 260k units.', 'I discussed this topic with a local friend, and I found interesting the impact EVs are having on the automotive market overall. The availability of cheap imports from China has triggered a generalized reduction in the prices of cars in the Kingdom.', 'New cars prices dropped significantly, with price reductions of up to 20% applied by dealers on the MSRP of some vehicles, especially those which are in direct competition against the Chinese imports. And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share. Thailand should soon be at around one out of every five new cars sold being electric, then one out of every four new cars sold being electric, then. …', 'But exponential growth is one thing. Disrupting pricing in the auto market and essentially chasing some companies out of it in the process is something else.', 'Cheap electric cars from China seem to be doing something special in Thailand. I’ m very curious to explore in more detail with local data sources, and even more than that, I’ m curious to see if these kinds of things are happening in other less-talked-about countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

","['The bad news just keeps on coming for fossil energy stakeholders. In the latest development, BMW is working with the leading California utility, PG & E, to demonstrate how EV batteries can contribute to grid stability instead of placing new burdens on the nation’ s electricity infrastructure. The secret sauce is V2X, the Vehicle-to-Everything model for using an EV battery to power all sorts of electric devices.', 'BMW is kicking vehicle-to-everything ( V2X) into high gear with an assist from the California utility PG & E. Photo courtesy of BMW.', 'The infrastructure argument against widespread EV adoption has been neatly summed up by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who called zero emission vehicles a “ new way to overburden California’ s already collapsing energy grid ” in a segment last September.', 'Whoa if true. However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity.', 'The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs.', 'On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase.', '“ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America.', 'As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere.', 'Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too.', '“ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains.', 'The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy.', 'So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways.

" Given the current reluctance of India to adopt electric vehicles despite its large market for them, what might be a motive behind Tesla's decision to open a manufacturing facility in India?

","['Shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, news is out that it plans a new factory in India.', 'India has surpassed China as the most populous nation in the world. Tesla has a gigafactory in China but none in India. India and China have had a number of disputes over the years, and Indian Prime Minister Modi has told Tesla in no uncertain terms that its Chinese-made automobiles are not welcome in his country. Negotiations have been on again/off again between Tesla and India for several years, with little forward progress being made. India imposes an import duty of up to 100% on vehicles manufactured in other countries.', 'In June, Elon Musk tore himself away from his chores as the owner of T * itter to visit with the Indian prime minister personally in the US, after which he pledged to begin manufacturing Tesla automobiles in India “ as soon as humanly possible. ” And why not? India is now the fourth largest new car market in the world, and yet Tesla — which is committed to promoting the EV revolution in every nation on Earth — has virtually no presence there.', 'After the meeting, Modi tweeted, “ Great meeting you today @ elonmusk! We had multifaceted conversations on issues ranging from energy to spirituality. ” For his part, Musk said he planned to visit India personally next year.', 'Now just a few weeks later, Reuters reports that Tesla is ready to invest in India by building a factory there that would have an annual production capacity of half a million vehicles. The report was first published by the Times of India and cited government sources. Those sources also claim that Tesla intends to use the factory in India as an export base to ship cars to other Asian countries.', 'A team from Tesla went to India in May for preliminary discussions with officials in that country about what incentives might be offered by the government for automobile and battery manufacturing, according to Reuters.', '“ Tesla has come to us with an ambitious plan and we are confident the movement will be positive this time around, especially as it involves both local manufacturing and exports, ” sources said. In fact it appears Tesla intends to start by exporting cars first in order to accurately measure the demand in Asian markets.', 'Building a new Tesla factory in India is good news, but here’ s the real meat in the stew: According to insiders with knowledge of the talks that have been going on since May, the starting price of the vehicles manufactured in India will be 2 million rupees, which translates at today’ s exchange rate to $ 24,401. Tesla does not currently offer a car at the price, so it is unclear at the moment what vehicle Tesla has in mind.', 'There have been rumors and vague statements floating around for a year of more about a so-called Model 2 or Model C or call it what you want that will sell for less that $ 25,000. Although, Tesla has been very tightlipped about how far along such a vehicle is, and when exactly it may find its way into production. Some observers think the new factory in Mexico will be the first to build such a car, and that it could do so next year. If that’ s the case, what about India too?', 'By the way, if that price seems low, there are several electric cars available to customers in India that are less expensive. The MG Comet sells for around $ 12,000 and the Tata Nexon EV lists for around $ 18,000. At the present time, the Tata is the best selling electric car in the country.', 'The Indian commerce and industry ministry is leading the talks with Tesla and hopes to put together a “ good deal ” while maintaining a level playing field, as talks now involve both local manufacturing and exports, according to local media sources.', 'As we reported last month, prime minister Modi was a staunch advocate for electric vehicles a few years ago. He even claiming that India would be the first country to reach 100% electric vehicles. Since those grand pronouncements, India hasn’ t done much to actually stimulate a lot of EV adoption. Perhaps things are changing, though.', 'Indian manufacturing powerhouse Tata Group is now making a big move into the space, reportedly investing 130 billion rupees ( $ 1.58 billion) into a lithium-ion battery cell factory in the country. At the moment, only 1% of Indian auto sales are EV sales, but Tata Motors is the leader in the sector.', 'That battery factory won’ t be coming online any time soon, however. Construction is scheduled to begin sometime in next 3 years. It is slated to have an annual production capacity of 20 GWh, with the possibility of increasing that to 40 GWh in a few years. The Tata battery factory will be located in Sanand, in northern Gujarat.', 'There was big news about battery raw materials in India recently. A large supply of lithium — almost 6 million tons — has been discovered in the states of Jammu & Kashmir, and the government is expected to begin auctioning off the mining rights to those reserves later this year.', 'The reserves, confirmed earlier this year, have placed India among the top five countries for lithium reserves in the world. The reserves are said to have a high purity and are graded at 500 parts per million compared to the normal grade of 220 parts per million.', 'India’ s minister for transportation has expressed optimism about the country’ s improved prospects as an EV powerhouse following conformation of the reserves’ purity and leading to claims that India could become the largest EV manufacturer in the world using them. The Indian government aims to achieve a 30% share of electric vehicles in private cars, 70% in commercial vehicles, and 80% in two- and three-wheeled vehicles by 2030.', 'India may be the largest country by population, but it lags far behind other large countries in terms of manufacturing prowess. By opening the door to Tesla, it could begin the transfer of technical skills it needs to become one of the world’ s leading economies. One thing we can be fairly certain of is that it won’ t take Tesla three years to get a factory built and into production.', 'This is a win/win for Tesla and India, the proverbial match made in heaven. We can’ t wait to find out what sort of vehicle the company plans to manufacture there and whether it will arrive one day in the US, where prospective EV purchasers are waiting anxiously for cars that are affordable.', ""Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him.

" What was the growth in Volkswagen Group's pure electric (BEV) sales in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2022?
","['Volkswagen Group’ s electric transition is continuing at a good pace. Its pure electric ( BEV) sales were up nearly 50% in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2022. They grew from 217,200 to 321,600. Furthermore, there are another 200,000 or so BEV orders on the books just in Western Europe.', 'Reaching 321,600 deliveries in the first half of the year, that was 7.4% of Volkswagen Group’ s overall vehicle deliveries. That’ s an increase from the company’ s 5.6% figure for the first half of 2022.', 'While Tesla is known to be the world leader in BEV sales ( and # 2 behind BYD in plugin vehicle sales), Volkswagen Group is actually # 1 in BEV sales in Europe. Furthermore, the company’ s sales growth in Europe even surpassed its sales growth worldwide. Sales grew from 128,900 in the first half of 2022 to 217,100 in the first half of 2023, which is 68% growth ( compared to 50% growth worldwide).', 'Additionally, the recent trend and expected trend going forward is even stronger than at the beginning of the year. “ With an increase in all-electric deliveries of around 50 percent in the first half of the year, the Volkswagen Group is systematically continuing its transformation, ” Hildegard Wortmann, member of Volkswagen Group’ s Extended Executive Committee for Sales, says. “ Since May, we have again seen an improved trend in incoming orders here, after a certain reluctance on the part of our customers at the start of the year due to reduced subsidy programs, partly long waiting times and high inflation. In view of the recent significant reduction in delivery times, we expect this positive trend to continue in the coming months. ”', 'The USA is coming through with big growth as well. Volkswagen Group reached 29,800 sales there, a 79% increase over the previous year.', 'However, there’ s one stain on the company’ s jacket. Deliveries were 2% lower in China, totaling 62,400. But Volkswagen Group brought out some positive news from there nonetheless — it did see 18% growth in BEV sales in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. So, we can say that the numbers are still rising fast there.', 'Looking at the second quarter more broadly — worldwide — deliveries were up 53%, from 118,000 in the second quarter of 2022 to 180,600 in the second quarter of 2023.', 'Volkswagen Group’ s BEV sales are dominated by sales in Europe, and then almost all of the rest of sales are in China and the USA. Europe accounts for 68% of sales, China 19%, and the USA 9%. That leaves 4% for the result of the world.', 'What about the brand split? There are approximately 100 auto brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella, right? ( Maybe not 100.) Volkswagen accounted for a little more than half of the auto group’ s BEV sales ( 164,800 vehicles), Audi accounted for 24% ( 75,600 vehicles), ŠKODA accounted for 10% ( 31,300 vehicles), SEAT/CUPRA accounted for 6% ( 18,900 vehicles), Porsche accounted for 6% ( 18,900 vehicles), and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles accounted for 4% ( 12,300 vehicles).', 'You can find more Volkswagen Group sales numbers or corporate commentary here.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

" What is the Hell's Kitchen geothermal brine lithium supply project, and what are its goals?

","['More EV battery activity is stirring over at the Hell’ s Kitchen geothermal brine lithium supply project.', 'The race to supply the global auto industry with enough lithium to fuel the switchover from gas to lithium-ion EV batteries is churning into high gear. The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project.', 'Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California.', 'The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain.', 'That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot.', '“ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed.', 'The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ”', 'The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground.', 'Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues. Among other recent battery recycling moves, last fall GM put up a stake in Series A financing for the recycling firm Lithion. Stellantis has also firmed up its end-of-life strategy under a joint venture with Galloo, announced in June.', 'Follow me tinamcasey on Bluesky, Threads, Post, LinkedIn, and Spoutible.', 'Image: Hell’ s Kitchen geothermal power plant and lithium supply facility with proposed EV battery operations, courtesy of CTR.', 'Tina specializes in military and corporate sustainability, advanced technology, emerging materials, biofuels, and water and wastewater issues.

" What was a major reason why bidders sat out the BOEM auction for offshore wind development in the Gulf of Mexico?

","['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid. Will offshore wind come to the Gulf in the future? “ We’ ll see, ” said the Zen master.', ""Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him.

" What is a significant partnership between Volvo Cars and another company to enhance electric mobility in Mexico?

","['With all of the EV news coming out of the United States, Canada, China, and Europe, sometimes it’ s easy to forget about some of our neighbors to the south. But that’ s a mistake. Many upcoming EVs for the U.S. market are being built in Mexico, and they need the benefits of electric drive down there just as much as we do. But, for my family down there, it’ s probably going to be a long time before I see them come visit in an EV, both because they’ re difficult to afford and because charging is hard to come by.', 'The same would be true if I wanted to take my Bolt to to visit the little town where my grandmother grew up. Safety issues aside, making the 400-mile round trip isn’ t really feasible, because the whole area is a giant charging dead zone. This is a real shame, because it’ s just a 3–4 hour trip into a neighboring state, and it wouldn’ t be a problem if the states were both on this side of the border. Seeing yet another barrier grow between us all isn’ t great.', 'That’ s why I thought it was great news when a press release came across the desk about a deal to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico. Volvo Cars has partnered with Evergo, a leading charging station platform for electric vehicles in the region, as part of its electrification strategy. This alliance aims to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide Volvo customers in Mexico and Latin America with access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers.', '“ Each of the actions we implement are firm steps that help us connect cities. We not only want to promote our objectives, we begin to make them a reality by offering an infrastructure solution that allows the mobility of users who have opted for an electric car, ” said Raymundo Cavazos, general director of Volvo Car México.', 'More importantly, it’ s no small deal. The collaboration aims to install 2,295 chargers in Mexico over the next 3 years, including 803 DC fast charging stations ( which the press release refers to as “ superchargers ”). The companies say this expansion will enhance range freedom for users by providing greater charging access along major routes, but they did not provide further specifics about locations.', 'But, they did share that 2,213 kilometers of tourist routes will soon connect more parts of the country.

" What is the impact of the negative bidding system in Germany's offshore wind auctions on the development of offshore wind energy projects?

","['Germany’ s Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA or Federal Network Agency) recently unveiled the outcomes of its largest-ever offshore wind auction, awarding 7 GW of new capacity. This significant achievement marks a substantial milestone in Germany’ s quest for renewable energy expansion and is worth about €12.6 billion or $ 13.96 billion.', 'At the Global Wind Energy Summit in Australia last month, offshore wind experts discussed the landmark auction started in April and completed in the middle of July with cautious excitement. Two of Europe’ s big oil companies, BP and Total Energies, won the bids in the North Sea totaling 6 GW and 1 GW in the Baltic Sea.', 'This September, renewed interest in the German auction came about because of the failure of the UK to secure takers for its own offshore wind projects.', 'But the win of BP and Total was seen differently and the impact of the negative bidding required project developers to essentially pay for the privilege of building their wind farms. While it undoubtedly ensured a cost-effective outcome for the government, the repercussions are far-reaching.', 'As an example, wind energy expert Ørsted chose to exit the German seabed lease auction before its completion this September, a Reuters report said last July. The report also indicated that company executives “ expressed concerns about high prices. ”', 'The negative bidding system inherently transfers additional costs to offshore wind developers, who must now decide where to allocate these expenses. The wind supply chain, which is already grappling with inflation and surging input costs, may find itself further burdened. Alternatively, consumers, who are already contending with rising electricity prices and the overall cost of living, may bear the brunt of this financial burden.', 'The Bundesnetzagentur is steadfast in its model to achieve its ambitious energy targets.', 'The outcome of this auction compels offshore wind developers to foot the staggering €12.6 billion bill to the German Government. Notably, 90% of these funds will be allocated to financing grid connection costs, while 5% will be devoted to protecting maritime biodiversity, and another 5% will support environmentally-friendly fishing initiatives.', 'The European Union is committed to enhancing energy security through domestically-sourced renewables, including wind energy. However, Germany’ s negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions could undermine these efforts.', 'Negative bidding allows developers to offer to pay the government to build offshore wind farms. This can lead to lower electricity prices for consumers, but it can also put downward pressure on profit margins for companies along the wind energy supply chain. This could discourage investment in new wind energy projects and make it more difficult to achieve the EU’ s renewable energy goals.', 'The German government is urged to reconsider the use of negative bidding in offshore wind energy auctions. Instead, the government should focus on supporting the development of the wind energy supply chain through investments in industrial capacity and infrastructure.', 'Germany plans to tender another 1.8 GW of offshore wind capacity before the end of this year or early 2024 using a different auction design that incorporates a non-price criteria. This is a welcome development according to wind energy experts, as it could help to reduce the unwanted impact of negative bidding on the wind energy supply chain.', 'Klaus Mueller, President of the Federal Network Agency, hailed these zero-cent bids as a positive sign for Germany’ s energy transition, indicating that offshore wind energy is economically viable without subsidies.', ""Raymond Gregory Tribdino is the motoring & information technology editor of Malaya Business Insight ( www.malaya.com.ph) in the Philippines.

One of the most iconic brands in the century-long optimization of automobile engines for sporty driving, with its own tagline being “ The Ultimate Driving Machine, ” BMW has ended the production of combustion engines in its home country of Germany.', 'Germany is one of the leading auto production nations in the world. Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve.', 'Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share.', '“ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports.', 'That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead.', 'Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020. ( It seems the transition could have been completed sooner.) Also, the German phaseout was planned for earlier this year but got delayed.', ""“ The 1,200 employees who previously worked in engine construction will now be retrained and deployed in other areas in future — either at the Munich plant or at other BMW locations.

" What is the evidence from the author's analysis that shows the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market outpacing the internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) market?

","['We recently produced several exclusive reports on US electric vehicle sales and overall US auto industry sales trends. Via those reports, you can explore the top automakers or auto brands in terms of their own internal EV share or in terms of their share of the overall EV market, or you can explore growth of the US EV market as a whole, or you can explore trends in auto brand sales broadly, or you can look at trends in EV market share, or you can look at model-by-model EV sales growth. There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what’ s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time.', 'However, one thing I’ ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market. ( To be specific, I’ m referring to the fully electric, or BEV, market here.) Since I’ d already collected all of the core data from automakers over the years, plus a little bit of estimating for brands that lag behind the rest in the data they report ( Tesla included), this wasn’ t a huge challenge — it just required creating a few more rows in my Google Sheet and generating a few more charts. However, I had not thought to do it until requested to by “ Cypress ” under a recent article. What a great suggestion! Why didn’ t I think of that?', 'Well, let’ s just get to the charts and numbers.', 'First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales. Wait, which powertrain is struggling with its sales trends?', 'Dipping back into the big, horrible year of COVID, EV sales were up 356% in 2023 compared to 2020, while ICEV sales were up just slightly, 1%.', 'Going even further back, looking at the pre-COVID numbers of 2019, we can see that EV sales were up 385% in 2023 compared to 2019, while ICEV sales were down 14%.', 'So, of all the ways we’ ve looked at changes in the EV market and changes in the auto market as a whole, I think these comparisons most clearly highlight that EV sales have been growing strongly year after year, whereas the non-EV market needs to worry about what’ s happening and plan accordingly.', 'Thanks to Cypress again for the request/idea for this report.', 'You can also look at these numbers in a slightly different way via the two charts below.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

Though, overall Cybertruck “ capacity ” at the company’ s factory in Texas is > 125,000 according to the shareholder letter. In other words, that’ s where they think they can max out production with the equipment currently installed at the gigafactory, and that’ s more than double the Cybertruck’ s current production rate high.', 'Unfortunately, no one asked about issues or limitations currently holding back higher Tesla Cybertruck production rates, so we don’ t know what issues Tesla is grappling with at the moment ( aside from the accelerator pedal recall).

Reading through that, I couldn’ t help chiming in by pulling out a couple of key highlights and expounding on them. In between, though, a reader contributed what might be the most interesting comment of all. Writing the comment under Steve’ s article, “ UjiBebek ” contributes the following:', 'During a recent trip to Thailand I noticed a significant number of Chinese EVs on the roads. According to data published recently, EVs sales in the first five months of 2024 increased by 31% to 43k units, while total vehicles sales dropped by 24%, down to 260k units.', 'I discussed this topic with a local friend, and I found interesting the impact EVs are having on the automotive market overall. The availability of cheap imports from China has triggered a generalized reduction in the prices of cars in the Kingdom.', 'New cars prices dropped significantly, with price reductions of up to 20% applied by dealers on the MSRP of some vehicles, especially those which are in direct competition against the Chinese imports. And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share. Thailand should soon be at around one out of every five new cars sold being electric, then one out of every four new cars sold being electric, then. …', 'But exponential growth is one thing. Disrupting pricing in the auto market and essentially chasing some companies out of it in the process is something else.', 'Cheap electric cars from China seem to be doing something special in Thailand.

" How can Electric Vehicles (EVs) contribute to grid stability and resiliency through the use of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology?

","['The bad news just keeps on coming for fossil energy stakeholders. In the latest development, BMW is working with the leading California utility, PG & E, to demonstrate how EV batteries can contribute to grid stability instead of placing new burdens on the nation’ s electricity infrastructure. The secret sauce is V2X, the Vehicle-to-Everything model for using an EV battery to power all sorts of electric devices.', 'BMW is kicking vehicle-to-everything ( V2X) into high gear with an assist from the California utility PG & E. Photo courtesy of BMW.', 'The infrastructure argument against widespread EV adoption has been neatly summed up by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who called zero emission vehicles a “ new way to overburden California’ s already collapsing energy grid ” in a segment last September.', 'Whoa if true. However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity.', 'The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs.', 'On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase.', '“ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America.', 'As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere.', 'Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too.', '“ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains.', 'The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy.', 'So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways. You can generate it with solar, with wind, in a camper, and with hydropower, ” an Army spokesperson said. “ Electricity is going to be the fuel of tomorrow. ”', 'No more Trainwreck Twitter.

","['Shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, news is out that it plans a new factory in India.', 'India has surpassed China as the most populous nation in the world. Tesla has a gigafactory in China but none in India. India and China have had a number of disputes over the years, and Indian Prime Minister Modi has told Tesla in no uncertain terms that its Chinese-made automobiles are not welcome in his country. Negotiations have been on again/off again between Tesla and India for several years, with little forward progress being made. India imposes an import duty of up to 100% on vehicles manufactured in other countries.', 'In June, Elon Musk tore himself away from his chores as the owner of T * itter to visit with the Indian prime minister personally in the US, after which he pledged to begin manufacturing Tesla automobiles in India “ as soon as humanly possible. ” And why not? India is now the fourth largest new car market in the world, and yet Tesla — which is committed to promoting the EV revolution in every nation on Earth — has virtually no presence there.', 'After the meeting, Modi tweeted, “ Great meeting you today @ elonmusk! We had multifaceted conversations on issues ranging from energy to spirituality. ” For his part, Musk said he planned to visit India personally next year.', 'Now just a few weeks later, Reuters reports that Tesla is ready to invest in India by building a factory there that would have an annual production capacity of half a million vehicles. The report was first published by the Times of India and cited government sources. Those sources also claim that Tesla intends to use the factory in India as an export base to ship cars to other Asian countries.', 'A team from Tesla went to India in May for preliminary discussions with officials in that country about what incentives might be offered by the government for automobile and battery manufacturing, according to Reuters.', '“ Tesla has come to us with an ambitious plan and we are confident the movement will be positive this time around, especially as it involves both local manufacturing and exports, ” sources said. In fact it appears Tesla intends to start by exporting cars first in order to accurately measure the demand in Asian markets.', 'Building a new Tesla factory in India is good news, but here’ s the real meat in the stew: According to insiders with knowledge of the talks that have been going on since May, the starting price of the vehicles manufactured in India will be 2 million rupees, which translates at today’ s exchange rate to $ 24,401. Tesla does not currently offer a car at the price, so it is unclear at the moment what vehicle Tesla has in mind.', 'There have been rumors and vague statements floating around for a year of more about a so-called Model 2 or Model C or call it what you want that will sell for less that $ 25,000. Although, Tesla has been very tightlipped about how far along such a vehicle is, and when exactly it may find its way into production. Some observers think the new factory in Mexico will be the first to build such a car, and that it could do so next year. If that’ s the case, what about India too?', 'By the way, if that price seems low, there are several electric cars available to customers in India that are less expensive. The MG Comet sells for around $ 12,000 and the Tata Nexon EV lists for around $ 18,000. At the present time, the Tata is the best selling electric car in the country.', 'The Indian commerce and industry ministry is leading the talks with Tesla and hopes to put together a “ good deal ” while maintaining a level playing field, as talks now involve both local manufacturing and exports, according to local media sources.', 'As we reported last month, prime minister Modi was a staunch advocate for electric vehicles a few years ago. He even claiming that India would be the first country to reach 100% electric vehicles. Since those grand pronouncements, India hasn’ t done much to actually stimulate a lot of EV adoption. Perhaps things are changing, though.', 'Indian manufacturing powerhouse Tata Group is now making a big move into the space, reportedly investing 130 billion rupees ( $ 1.58 billion) into a lithium-ion battery cell factory in the country. At the moment, only 1% of Indian auto sales are EV sales, but Tata Motors is the leader in the sector.', 'That battery factory won’ t be coming online any time soon, however. Construction is scheduled to begin sometime in next 3 years. It is slated to have an annual production capacity of 20 GWh, with the possibility of increasing that to 40 GWh in a few years. The Tata battery factory will be located in Sanand, in northern Gujarat.', 'There was big news about battery raw materials in India recently. A large supply of lithium — almost 6 million tons — has been discovered in the states of Jammu & Kashmir, and the government is expected to begin auctioning off the mining rights to those reserves later this year.', 'The reserves, confirmed earlier this year, have placed India among the top five countries for lithium reserves in the world. The reserves are said to have a high purity and are graded at 500 parts per million compared to the normal grade of 220 parts per million.', 'India’ s minister for transportation has expressed optimism about the country’ s improved prospects as an EV powerhouse following conformation of the reserves’ purity and leading to claims that India could become the largest EV manufacturer in the world using them. The Indian government aims to achieve a 30% share of electric vehicles in private cars, 70% in commercial vehicles, and 80% in two- and three-wheeled vehicles by 2030.', 'India may be the largest country by population, but it lags far behind other large countries in terms of manufacturing prowess. By opening the door to Tesla, it could begin the transfer of technical skills it needs to become one of the world’ s leading economies. One thing we can be fairly certain of is that it won’ t take Tesla three years to get a factory built and into production.', 'This is a win/win for Tesla and India, the proverbial match made in heaven.

The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ”', 'The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground.', 'Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues.

" What were some of the main reasons that prevented offshore wind development in the Gulf of Mexico from moving forward in the recent auction?

","['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid. Will offshore wind come to the Gulf in the future? “ We’ ll see, ” said the Zen master.', ""Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him.

" How many charging stations will Volvo and Evergo install in Mexico as part of their partnership to support electric vehicle adoption?

","['With all of the EV news coming out of the United States, Canada, China, and Europe, sometimes it’ s easy to forget about some of our neighbors to the south. But that’ s a mistake. Many upcoming EVs for the U.S. market are being built in Mexico, and they need the benefits of electric drive down there just as much as we do. But, for my family down there, it’ s probably going to be a long time before I see them come visit in an EV, both because they’ re difficult to afford and because charging is hard to come by.', 'The same would be true if I wanted to take my Bolt to to visit the little town where my grandmother grew up. Safety issues aside, making the 400-mile round trip isn’ t really feasible, because the whole area is a giant charging dead zone. This is a real shame, because it’ s just a 3–4 hour trip into a neighboring state, and it wouldn’ t be a problem if the states were both on this side of the border. Seeing yet another barrier grow between us all isn’ t great.', 'That’ s why I thought it was great news when a press release came across the desk about a deal to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico. Volvo Cars has partnered with Evergo, a leading charging station platform for electric vehicles in the region, as part of its electrification strategy. This alliance aims to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide Volvo customers in Mexico and Latin America with access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers.', '“ Each of the actions we implement are firm steps that help us connect cities. We not only want to promote our objectives, we begin to make them a reality by offering an infrastructure solution that allows the mobility of users who have opted for an electric car, ” said Raymundo Cavazos, general director of Volvo Car México.', 'More importantly, it’ s no small deal. The collaboration aims to install 2,295 chargers in Mexico over the next 3 years, including 803 DC fast charging stations ( which the press release refers to as “ superchargers ”). The companies say this expansion will enhance range freedom for users by providing greater charging access along major routes, but they did not provide further specifics about locations.', 'But, they did share that 2,213 kilometers of tourist routes will soon connect more parts of the country. Chargers are already installed in the Puebla-San Luis Potosí Corridor, and by the end of 2024, new routes like Mexico City-Acapulco, Guadalajara-Puerto Vallarta, Tijuana-Ensenada, Mérida-Cancún, and Monterrey-McAllen will be connected.', '“ This alliance leads us towards an increasingly promising horizon in terms of electric mobility in Mexico. Through this shared commitment, we ensure that in the short term, a greater number of users can enjoy the benefits of more sustainable mobility, backed by the most advanced technology on the market, and with the necessary confidence to reach the main destinations. of the country without worrying about running out of charge, ” said Daniel López, commercial director of Evergo Mexico.', 'The Evergo and Volvo alliance also extends to Latin America, enabling Volvo users in multiple countries to access the charging network available in Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. The Swedish company also collaborates with VEMO, a cleantech company that integrates the entire clean mobility ecosystem. Together, they have agreed on the installation of 70 chargers in shopping centers and universities.', '“ By 2025 we have a commitment that half of Volvo vehicles will be fully electric. Our mission is to take care of people, future generations and the environment, electrification plays an essential role in achieving this goal, ” added Raymundo Cavazos, CEO of Volvo Car Mexico.', 'Since launching the Volvo XC40 Recharge in 2021, Volvo has provided a charger to each of its electric vehicle customers, resulting in around 800 home charging network chargers across Latin America as well.', 'Finally, the companies said that starting next year, Volvo electric vehicles will be equipped with the NACS-type connector in Mexico just as they will in the United States and Canada, enabling brand users to utilize Tesla’ s chargers across North America. In Mexico, there will be a total of 660 chargers available, including 60 Superchargers, allowing for even more expansion of charging opportunities for Volvo customers.', 'Considering that there are only 60 Supercharger stations in Mexico and a few dozen CCS or CHAdeMO stations, the deal Volvo and Evergo announced will make a big impact. But, at the same time, it’ s not cause for complacency.', 'Economic trade beyond just tourism to the most popular destinations needs to be a priority. And economic trade isn’ t all semi-trucks and big maquiladora plants along the border, either. There are so, so many small businesses and family businesses that depend on going back and forth across the border in smaller vehicles, too.', 'In other words, Mexico is a much more important trading partner than many people realize, in terms of both current reality and in the potential that exists.', 'To watch the United States and Canada embark on a big move to a different model for fueling our transportation systems is great, but we risk losing circulation to our feet and losing them if we don’ t make sure all of our neighbors are making the journey with us. And don’ t take that as any insult to Mexico, because as anybody who lost their feet can tell you, they’ re something you can’ t easily live without.', 'For this reason, we should encourage more automotive manufacturers to expand their charging presence along highways in Mexico. We should also encourage the U.S. and Canadian governments to pitch in and expand charging opportunities the same way they have been doing in their own countries.', 'To many people, the language and cultural barriers may seem insurmountable, and Mexico might seem like some far-off and exotic place, but to many of us, it’ s both family and an essential trading partner.

" What is the name of the German government agency responsible for awarding new offshore wind capacity in the country's recent auction?

","['Germany’ s Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA or Federal Network Agency) recently unveiled the outcomes of its largest-ever offshore wind auction, awarding 7 GW of new capacity. This significant achievement marks a substantial milestone in Germany’ s quest for renewable energy expansion and is worth about €12.6 billion or $ 13.96 billion.', 'At the Global Wind Energy Summit in Australia last month, offshore wind experts discussed the landmark auction started in April and completed in the middle of July with cautious excitement. Two of Europe’ s big oil companies, BP and Total Energies, won the bids in the North Sea totaling 6 GW and 1 GW in the Baltic Sea.', 'This September, renewed interest in the German auction came about because of the failure of the UK to secure takers for its own offshore wind projects.', 'But the win of BP and Total was seen differently and the impact of the negative bidding required project developers to essentially pay for the privilege of building their wind farms. While it undoubtedly ensured a cost-effective outcome for the government, the repercussions are far-reaching.', 'As an example, wind energy expert Ørsted chose to exit the German seabed lease auction before its completion this September, a Reuters report said last July. The report also indicated that company executives “ expressed concerns about high prices. ”', 'The negative bidding system inherently transfers additional costs to offshore wind developers, who must now decide where to allocate these expenses. The wind supply chain, which is already grappling with inflation and surging input costs, may find itself further burdened. Alternatively, consumers, who are already contending with rising electricity prices and the overall cost of living, may bear the brunt of this financial burden.', 'The Bundesnetzagentur is steadfast in its model to achieve its ambitious energy targets.', 'The outcome of this auction compels offshore wind developers to foot the staggering €12.6 billion bill to the German Government. Notably, 90% of these funds will be allocated to financing grid connection costs, while 5% will be devoted to protecting maritime biodiversity, and another 5% will support environmentally-friendly fishing initiatives.', 'The European Union is committed to enhancing energy security through domestically-sourced renewables, including wind energy. However, Germany’ s negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions could undermine these efforts.', 'Negative bidding allows developers to offer to pay the government to build offshore wind farms. This can lead to lower electricity prices for consumers, but it can also put downward pressure on profit margins for companies along the wind energy supply chain. This could discourage investment in new wind energy projects and make it more difficult to achieve the EU’ s renewable energy goals.', 'The German government is urged to reconsider the use of negative bidding in offshore wind energy auctions. Instead, the government should focus on supporting the development of the wind energy supply chain through investments in industrial capacity and infrastructure.', 'Germany plans to tender another 1.8 GW of offshore wind capacity before the end of this year or early 2024 using a different auction design that incorporates a non-price criteria. This is a welcome development according to wind energy experts, as it could help to reduce the unwanted impact of negative bidding on the wind energy supply chain.', 'Klaus Mueller, President of the Federal Network Agency, hailed these zero-cent bids as a positive sign for Germany’ s energy transition, indicating that offshore wind energy is economically viable without subsidies.', ""Raymond Gregory Tribdino is the motoring & information technology editor of Malaya Business Insight ( www.malaya.com.ph) in the Philippines.

Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve.', 'Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share.', '“ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports.', 'That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead.', 'Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020.

" What is the difference in annual growth rate between electric vehicle (EV) sales and internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) sales?
","['We recently produced several exclusive reports on US electric vehicle sales and overall US auto industry sales trends. Via those reports, you can explore the top automakers or auto brands in terms of their own internal EV share or in terms of their share of the overall EV market, or you can explore growth of the US EV market as a whole, or you can explore trends in auto brand sales broadly, or you can look at trends in EV market share, or you can look at model-by-model EV sales growth. There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what’ s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time.', 'However, one thing I’ ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market. ( To be specific, I’ m referring to the fully electric, or BEV, market here.) Since I’ d already collected all of the core data from automakers over the years, plus a little bit of estimating for brands that lag behind the rest in the data they report ( Tesla included), this wasn’ t a huge challenge — it just required creating a few more rows in my Google Sheet and generating a few more charts. However, I had not thought to do it until requested to by “ Cypress ” under a recent article. What a great suggestion! Why didn’ t I think of that?', 'Well, let’ s just get to the charts and numbers.', 'First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales. Wait, which powertrain is struggling with its sales trends?', 'Dipping back into the big, horrible year of COVID, EV sales were up 356% in 2023 compared to 2020, while ICEV sales were up just slightly, 1%.', 'Going even further back, looking at the pre-COVID numbers of 2019, we can see that EV sales were up 385% in 2023 compared to 2019, while ICEV sales were down 14%.', 'So, of all the ways we’ ve looked at changes in the EV market and changes in the auto market as a whole, I think these comparisons most clearly highlight that EV sales have been growing strongly year after year, whereas the non-EV market needs to worry about what’ s happening and plan accordingly.', 'Thanks to Cypress again for the request/idea for this report.', 'You can also look at these numbers in a slightly different way via the two charts below.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

Nonetheless, Cybertruck production capacity is slowly ramping up.', 'In the Tesla shareholder letter today and then also on the conference call, it was stated that Tesla reached production of 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week a couple of weeks ago. Of course, that just translates to about 52,000 trucks a year, which is far from Tesla’ s target, but they were proud to boast about this new weekly high.', '“ The Cybertruck ramp continued successfully at Gigafactory Texas, with a sequential cost improvement in Q1.

Though, overall Cybertruck “ capacity ” at the company’ s factory in Texas is > 125,000 according to the shareholder letter. In other words, that’ s where they think they can max out production with the equipment currently installed at the gigafactory, and that’ s more than double the Cybertruck’ s current production rate high.', 'Unfortunately, no one asked about issues or limitations currently holding back higher Tesla Cybertruck production rates, so we don’ t know what issues Tesla is grappling with at the moment ( aside from the accelerator pedal recall). Where will Cybertruck production be at the end of this quarter? It’ s anyone’ s guess. It could still be at a high of 1,000/week, it could double to 2,000/week, or perhaps it could even triple to 3,000/week.

","['The new AlixPartners report 2024 Global Automotive Outlook has stimulated quite a lot of thoughts and feedback. Steve Hanley kicked things off with his summary of the findings. Reading through that, I couldn’ t help chiming in by pulling out a couple of key highlights and expounding on them. In between, though, a reader contributed what might be the most interesting comment of all. Writing the comment under Steve’ s article, “ UjiBebek ” contributes the following:', 'During a recent trip to Thailand I noticed a significant number of Chinese EVs on the roads. According to data published recently, EVs sales in the first five months of 2024 increased by 31% to 43k units, while total vehicles sales dropped by 24%, down to 260k units.', 'I discussed this topic with a local friend, and I found interesting the impact EVs are having on the automotive market overall. The availability of cheap imports from China has triggered a generalized reduction in the prices of cars in the Kingdom.', 'New cars prices dropped significantly, with price reductions of up to 20% applied by dealers on the MSRP of some vehicles, especially those which are in direct competition against the Chinese imports. And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024.', 'But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks.', 'This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle.', 'So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share. Thailand should soon be at around one out of every five new cars sold being electric, then one out of every four new cars sold being electric, then. …', 'But exponential growth is one thing. Disrupting pricing in the auto market and essentially chasing some companies out of it in the process is something else.', 'Cheap electric cars from China seem to be doing something special in Thailand.

","['The bad news just keeps on coming for fossil energy stakeholders. In the latest development, BMW is working with the leading California utility, PG & E, to demonstrate how EV batteries can contribute to grid stability instead of placing new burdens on the nation’ s electricity infrastructure. The secret sauce is V2X, the Vehicle-to-Everything model for using an EV battery to power all sorts of electric devices.', 'BMW is kicking vehicle-to-everything ( V2X) into high gear with an assist from the California utility PG & E. Photo courtesy of BMW.', 'The infrastructure argument against widespread EV adoption has been neatly summed up by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who called zero emission vehicles a “ new way to overburden California’ s already collapsing energy grid ” in a segment last September.', 'Whoa if true. However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity.', 'The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs.', 'On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption.', 'V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix.', 'None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates.', 'The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid.', 'The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet.', '“ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement.', 'The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase.', '“ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America.', 'As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere.', 'Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too.', '“ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains.', 'The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy.', 'So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good.', '“ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported.', 'PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables.', 'In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles.', '“ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners.', 'PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more.', 'Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner.', '“ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways.

","['Shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, news is out that it plans a new factory in India.', 'India has surpassed China as the most populous nation in the world. Tesla has a gigafactory in China but none in India. India and China have had a number of disputes over the years, and Indian Prime Minister Modi has told Tesla in no uncertain terms that its Chinese-made automobiles are not welcome in his country. Negotiations have been on again/off again between Tesla and India for several years, with little forward progress being made. India imposes an import duty of up to 100% on vehicles manufactured in other countries.', 'In June, Elon Musk tore himself away from his chores as the owner of T * itter to visit with the Indian prime minister personally in the US, after which he pledged to begin manufacturing Tesla automobiles in India “ as soon as humanly possible. ” And why not? India is now the fourth largest new car market in the world, and yet Tesla — which is committed to promoting the EV revolution in every nation on Earth — has virtually no presence there.', 'After the meeting, Modi tweeted, “ Great meeting you today @ elonmusk! We had multifaceted conversations on issues ranging from energy to spirituality. ” For his part, Musk said he planned to visit India personally next year.', 'Now just a few weeks later, Reuters reports that Tesla is ready to invest in India by building a factory there that would have an annual production capacity of half a million vehicles. The report was first published by the Times of India and cited government sources. Those sources also claim that Tesla intends to use the factory in India as an export base to ship cars to other Asian countries.', 'A team from Tesla went to India in May for preliminary discussions with officials in that country about what incentives might be offered by the government for automobile and battery manufacturing, according to Reuters.', '“ Tesla has come to us with an ambitious plan and we are confident the movement will be positive this time around, especially as it involves both local manufacturing and exports, ” sources said. In fact it appears Tesla intends to start by exporting cars first in order to accurately measure the demand in Asian markets.', 'Building a new Tesla factory in India is good news, but here’ s the real meat in the stew: According to insiders with knowledge of the talks that have been going on since May, the starting price of the vehicles manufactured in India will be 2 million rupees, which translates at today’ s exchange rate to $ 24,401. Tesla does not currently offer a car at the price, so it is unclear at the moment what vehicle Tesla has in mind.', 'There have been rumors and vague statements floating around for a year of more about a so-called Model 2 or Model C or call it what you want that will sell for less that $ 25,000. Although, Tesla has been very tightlipped about how far along such a vehicle is, and when exactly it may find its way into production. Some observers think the new factory in Mexico will be the first to build such a car, and that it could do so next year.

" What was the percentage increase in Volkswagen Group's pure electric (BEV) sales in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2022?
","['Volkswagen Group’ s electric transition is continuing at a good pace. Its pure electric ( BEV) sales were up nearly 50% in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2022. They grew from 217,200 to 321,600. Furthermore, there are another 200,000 or so BEV orders on the books just in Western Europe.', 'Reaching 321,600 deliveries in the first half of the year, that was 7.4% of Volkswagen Group’ s overall vehicle deliveries. That’ s an increase from the company’ s 5.6% figure for the first half of 2022.', 'While Tesla is known to be the world leader in BEV sales ( and # 2 behind BYD in plugin vehicle sales), Volkswagen Group is actually # 1 in BEV sales in Europe. Furthermore, the company’ s sales growth in Europe even surpassed its sales growth worldwide. Sales grew from 128,900 in the first half of 2022 to 217,100 in the first half of 2023, which is 68% growth ( compared to 50% growth worldwide).', 'Additionally, the recent trend and expected trend going forward is even stronger than at the beginning of the year. “ With an increase in all-electric deliveries of around 50 percent in the first half of the year, the Volkswagen Group is systematically continuing its transformation, ” Hildegard Wortmann, member of Volkswagen Group’ s Extended Executive Committee for Sales, says. “ Since May, we have again seen an improved trend in incoming orders here, after a certain reluctance on the part of our customers at the start of the year due to reduced subsidy programs, partly long waiting times and high inflation. In view of the recent significant reduction in delivery times, we expect this positive trend to continue in the coming months. ”', 'The USA is coming through with big growth as well. Volkswagen Group reached 29,800 sales there, a 79% increase over the previous year.', 'However, there’ s one stain on the company’ s jacket. Deliveries were 2% lower in China, totaling 62,400. But Volkswagen Group brought out some positive news from there nonetheless — it did see 18% growth in BEV sales in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. So, we can say that the numbers are still rising fast there.', 'Looking at the second quarter more broadly — worldwide — deliveries were up 53%, from 118,000 in the second quarter of 2022 to 180,600 in the second quarter of 2023.', 'Volkswagen Group’ s BEV sales are dominated by sales in Europe, and then almost all of the rest of sales are in China and the USA.

" How much lithium hydroxide per year is Hell's Kitchen expected to produce, according to the company Controlled Thermal Resources (CTR)?

","['More EV battery activity is stirring over at the Hell’ s Kitchen geothermal brine lithium supply project.', 'The race to supply the global auto industry with enough lithium to fuel the switchover from gas to lithium-ion EV batteries is churning into high gear. The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project.', 'Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California.', 'The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain.', 'That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot.', '“ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed.', 'The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ”', 'The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances.', 'In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem.', '“ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website.', 'The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed.', 'The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further.', 'Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project.', 'Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ”', '“ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ”', 'If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027.', 'The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that.', 'The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons.', 'The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s.', 'Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists.', 'NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain.', '“ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ”', 'Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres.', 'In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground.', 'Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues. Among other recent battery recycling moves, last fall GM put up a stake in Series A financing for the recycling firm Lithion.

" What were some of the reasons that prevented many potential bidders from participating in the BOEM auction for offshore wind leases in the Gulf of Mexico?

","['The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction.', 'It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana.', 'Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans.', 'On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration.', 'The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters.', 'Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ”', 'The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm.', 'Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap.', 'And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ”', 'While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian.', 'Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries.', 'Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ”', 'The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ”', 'Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf.', 'As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry.', 'Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation.', 'To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon.', 'Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan.', 'Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid. Will offshore wind come to the Gulf in the future? “ We’ ll see, ” said the Zen master.', ""Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Florida or anywhere else The Force may lead him.

" What is Volvo Cars' plan to provide electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Mexico, and how many chargers will be installed?

","['With all of the EV news coming out of the United States, Canada, China, and Europe, sometimes it’ s easy to forget about some of our neighbors to the south. But that’ s a mistake. Many upcoming EVs for the U.S. market are being built in Mexico, and they need the benefits of electric drive down there just as much as we do. But, for my family down there, it’ s probably going to be a long time before I see them come visit in an EV, both because they’ re difficult to afford and because charging is hard to come by.', 'The same would be true if I wanted to take my Bolt to to visit the little town where my grandmother grew up. Safety issues aside, making the 400-mile round trip isn’ t really feasible, because the whole area is a giant charging dead zone. This is a real shame, because it’ s just a 3–4 hour trip into a neighboring state, and it wouldn’ t be a problem if the states were both on this side of the border. Seeing yet another barrier grow between us all isn’ t great.', 'That’ s why I thought it was great news when a press release came across the desk about a deal to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico. Volvo Cars has partnered with Evergo, a leading charging station platform for electric vehicles in the region, as part of its electrification strategy. This alliance aims to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide Volvo customers in Mexico and Latin America with access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers.', '“ Each of the actions we implement are firm steps that help us connect cities. We not only want to promote our objectives, we begin to make them a reality by offering an infrastructure solution that allows the mobility of users who have opted for an electric car, ” said Raymundo Cavazos, general director of Volvo Car México.', 'More importantly, it’ s no small deal. The collaboration aims to install 2,295 chargers in Mexico over the next 3 years, including 803 DC fast charging stations ( which the press release refers to as “ superchargers ”). The companies say this expansion will enhance range freedom for users by providing greater charging access along major routes, but they did not provide further specifics about locations.', 'But, they did share that 2,213 kilometers of tourist routes will soon connect more parts of the country. Chargers are already installed in the Puebla-San Luis Potosí Corridor, and by the end of 2024, new routes like Mexico City-Acapulco, Guadalajara-Puerto Vallarta, Tijuana-Ensenada, Mérida-Cancún, and Monterrey-McAllen will be connected.', '“ This alliance leads us towards an increasingly promising horizon in terms of electric mobility in Mexico. Through this shared commitment, we ensure that in the short term, a greater number of users can enjoy the benefits of more sustainable mobility, backed by the most advanced technology on the market, and with the necessary confidence to reach the main destinations. of the country without worrying about running out of charge, ” said Daniel López, commercial director of Evergo Mexico.', 'The Evergo and Volvo alliance also extends to Latin America, enabling Volvo users in multiple countries to access the charging network available in Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. The Swedish company also collaborates with VEMO, a cleantech company that integrates the entire clean mobility ecosystem. Together, they have agreed on the installation of 70 chargers in shopping centers and universities.', '“ By 2025 we have a commitment that half of Volvo vehicles will be fully electric. Our mission is to take care of people, future generations and the environment, electrification plays an essential role in achieving this goal, ” added Raymundo Cavazos, CEO of Volvo Car Mexico.', 'Since launching the Volvo XC40 Recharge in 2021, Volvo has provided a charger to each of its electric vehicle customers, resulting in around 800 home charging network chargers across Latin America as well.', 'Finally, the companies said that starting next year, Volvo electric vehicles will be equipped with the NACS-type connector in Mexico just as they will in the United States and Canada, enabling brand users to utilize Tesla’ s chargers across North America. In Mexico, there will be a total of 660 chargers available, including 60 Superchargers, allowing for even more expansion of charging opportunities for Volvo customers.', 'Considering that there are only 60 Supercharger stations in Mexico and a few dozen CCS or CHAdeMO stations, the deal Volvo and Evergo announced will make a big impact. But, at the same time, it’ s not cause for complacency.', 'Economic trade beyond just tourism to the most popular destinations needs to be a priority. And economic trade isn’ t all semi-trucks and big maquiladora plants along the border, either. There are so, so many small businesses and family businesses that depend on going back and forth across the border in smaller vehicles, too.', 'In other words, Mexico is a much more important trading partner than many people realize, in terms of both current reality and in the potential that exists.', 'To watch the United States and Canada embark on a big move to a different model for fueling our transportation systems is great, but we risk losing circulation to our feet and losing them if we don’ t make sure all of our neighbors are making the journey with us. And don’ t take that as any insult to Mexico, because as anybody who lost their feet can tell you, they’ re something you can’ t easily live without.', 'For this reason, we should encourage more automotive manufacturers to expand their charging presence along highways in Mexico. We should also encourage the U.S. and Canadian governments to pitch in and expand charging opportunities the same way they have been doing in their own countries.', 'To many people, the language and cultural barriers may seem insurmountable, and Mexico might seem like some far-off and exotic place, but to many of us, it’ s both family and an essential trading partner.

" How is the German government's use of a negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions affecting the cost of wind energy and the renewable energy supply chain?

","['Germany’ s Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA or Federal Network Agency) recently unveiled the outcomes of its largest-ever offshore wind auction, awarding 7 GW of new capacity. This significant achievement marks a substantial milestone in Germany’ s quest for renewable energy expansion and is worth about €12.6 billion or $ 13.96 billion.', 'At the Global Wind Energy Summit in Australia last month, offshore wind experts discussed the landmark auction started in April and completed in the middle of July with cautious excitement. Two of Europe’ s big oil companies, BP and Total Energies, won the bids in the North Sea totaling 6 GW and 1 GW in the Baltic Sea.', 'This September, renewed interest in the German auction came about because of the failure of the UK to secure takers for its own offshore wind projects.', 'But the win of BP and Total was seen differently and the impact of the negative bidding required project developers to essentially pay for the privilege of building their wind farms. While it undoubtedly ensured a cost-effective outcome for the government, the repercussions are far-reaching.', 'As an example, wind energy expert Ørsted chose to exit the German seabed lease auction before its completion this September, a Reuters report said last July. The report also indicated that company executives “ expressed concerns about high prices. ”', 'The negative bidding system inherently transfers additional costs to offshore wind developers, who must now decide where to allocate these expenses. The wind supply chain, which is already grappling with inflation and surging input costs, may find itself further burdened. Alternatively, consumers, who are already contending with rising electricity prices and the overall cost of living, may bear the brunt of this financial burden.', 'The Bundesnetzagentur is steadfast in its model to achieve its ambitious energy targets.', 'The outcome of this auction compels offshore wind developers to foot the staggering €12.6 billion bill to the German Government. Notably, 90% of these funds will be allocated to financing grid connection costs, while 5% will be devoted to protecting maritime biodiversity, and another 5% will support environmentally-friendly fishing initiatives.', 'The European Union is committed to enhancing energy security through domestically-sourced renewables, including wind energy. However, Germany’ s negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions could undermine these efforts.', 'Negative bidding allows developers to offer to pay the government to build offshore wind farms. This can lead to lower electricity prices for consumers, but it can also put downward pressure on profit margins for companies along the wind energy supply chain. This could discourage investment in new wind energy projects and make it more difficult to achieve the EU’ s renewable energy goals.', 'The German government is urged to reconsider the use of negative bidding in offshore wind energy auctions. Instead, the government should focus on supporting the development of the wind energy supply chain through investments in industrial capacity and infrastructure.', 'Germany plans to tender another 1.8 GW of offshore wind capacity before the end of this year or early 2024 using a different auction design that incorporates a non-price criteria. This is a welcome development according to wind energy experts, as it could help to reduce the unwanted impact of negative bidding on the wind energy supply chain.', 'Klaus Mueller, President of the Federal Network Agency, hailed these zero-cent bids as a positive sign for Germany’ s energy transition, indicating that offshore wind energy is economically viable without subsidies.', ""Raymond Gregory Tribdino is the motoring & information technology editor of Malaya Business Insight ( www.malaya.com.ph) in the Philippines.

One of the most iconic brands in the century-long optimization of automobile engines for sporty driving, with its own tagline being “ The Ultimate Driving Machine, ” BMW has ended the production of combustion engines in its home country of Germany.', 'Germany is one of the leading auto production nations in the world. Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve.', 'Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share.', '“ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports.', 'That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead.', 'Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020.

","['We recently produced several exclusive reports on US electric vehicle sales and overall US auto industry sales trends. Via those reports, you can explore the top automakers or auto brands in terms of their own internal EV share or in terms of their share of the overall EV market, or you can explore growth of the US EV market as a whole, or you can explore trends in auto brand sales broadly, or you can look at trends in EV market share, or you can look at model-by-model EV sales growth. There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what’ s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time.', 'However, one thing I’ ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market.

Why didn’ t I think of that?', 'Well, let’ s just get to the charts and numbers.', 'First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales.

Nonetheless, Cybertruck production capacity is slowly ramping up.', 'In the Tesla shareholder letter today and then also on the conference call, it was stated that Tesla reached production of 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week a couple of weeks ago.

Though, overall Cybertruck “ capacity ” at the company’ s factory in Texas is > 125,000 according to the shareholder letter. In other words, that’ s where they think they can max out production with the equipment currently installed at the gigafactory, and that’ s more than double the Cybertruck’ s current production rate high.', 'Unfortunately, no one asked about issues or limitations currently holding back higher Tesla Cybertruck production rates, so we don’ t know what issues Tesla is grappling with at the moment ( aside from the accelerator pedal recall). Where will Cybertruck production be at the end of this quarter? It’ s anyone’ s guess.

" What is the current trend in public perception of nuclear energy in the UK, and how is it likely to be influenced by the Government's classification of nuclear as ""environmentally sustainable""?

","['In the Spring Budget, the Chancellor confirmed nuclear as “ environmentally sustainable ” removing an element of uncertainty which will enable the UK to plan and finance nuclear energy infrastructure in the long term. However, building confidence in technology and equipment will be key for the UK Government in delivering new nuclear power generation.', 'The perception of nuclear technology by both investors and the general public is largely based on well-known and highly publicised international events – most notably, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the more recent 2011 accident in Fukushima. Both of these incidents were preventable, had international best practice and standards been observed.', 'In the past 10 years, however, there has been a slow but positive shift in the perception of nuclear energy by the UK public. In 2012, only 9% strongly supported the technology and 29% supported its use for electricity generation. According to Statista, this increased to 18% strongly supporting and 24% supporting by 2022 and, those opposing or strongly opposing, dropping from 27% in 2012 to 13% in 2022.', 'The recent energy crisis has further driven positive sentiment toward the technology. A 2023 survey found a 25% increase in net support for new nuclear power since June 2021, with support growing across every age group and nation across the UK.', 'This shift in perception will be bolstered by the Government’ s classification of nuclear as “ environmentally sustainable ”. This is particularly important when considering the benefits that small modular reactors ( SMRs) could offer the UK’ s electricity network, another focus of the Spring Budget.', 'Smaller-scale power plants offer the potential to leverage modular off-site manufacturing for flexible deployment, but most importantly, they require less water for cooling and can therefore be located further inland than typical nuclear energy facilities. This means that SMRs could be located closer to where the energy demand is higher – reducing the amount of infrastructure required to transfer energy to where it is needed.', 'The UK Government has launched “ Great British Nuclear ” with a mission to identify the best small modular reactor ( SMR) technology for the UK. Whether this will be the Rolls Royce SMR initially proposed at three sites, or one of the other available technologies, there will be a need to ensure that the UK has the manufacturing capability, innovation and skills necessary to capitalise on this opportunity.', 'As with any emerging technology, there is an abundance of caution around the use of SMRs, from the Government and investors, but particularly the general public who know little about the technology.', 'The nuclear industry is already highly regulated, but energy companies can go further to help build confidence to garner the support of stakeholder, investors and the general public.

" What type of electrolysis is likely to hold great potential, but is still in early stages of commercialization, due to using a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte?

","['The challenges to making green hydrogen production commercially viable can be tackled if the right technology and economic infrastructure are in place, writes Maria Anez-Lingerfelt, senior scientist at Pall Corporation.', 'The demand for new green energy strategies is increasing and hydrogen is regarded as a key factor in meeting international emissions targets and achieving net zero by 2050. The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks.', 'In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen.

" Does the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology pose a barrier to further emissions reductions in the pulp and paper sector, or is it necessary to achieve net-zero emissions?

","['Carbon capture and storage ( CCS) has long been touted as part of the solution to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.', 'Fast forward to 2023 and global policy experts increasingly identify CCS as an essential part of the global path to maintaining the Paris Agreement’ s target of limiting global temperate rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.', 'One of the persistent arguments against the use of CCS is that it will prolong the transition away from the use of fossil fuels and thereby prolong the ‘ fossil fuel age’. Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement.', 'Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good.', 'Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.', 'This may be because climate change is impacting Canada’ s forests or because policy makers decide that in order to meet the world’ s Paris commitments, all CO2 emissions need to be treated equally.', 'As a result, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is having to look to bioenergy with CCS ( or BECCS). This is not because it is seeking to avoid abatement but rather because it was an early adopter of clean technologies and now has limited viable options to reduce emissions further.', 'Implementing BECCS is the most economically and technologically feasible pathway to further emissions reductions of total carbon at many Canadian pulp and paper facilities. As forest management practices continue to improve to maximise the carbon sequestered in Canada’ s forests and long-lived wood products, there is also a realistic potential for the use of BECCS to contribute to the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere and become a negative emissions technology ( NET).', 'It is widely accepted, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC), that the use of NETs will be essential to meet our commitment to 1.5C.', 'At this juncture in the race to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there is no silver bullet.']"," According to the text, CCS technology is not a barrier to emissions reductions in the pulp and paper sector, but rather is seen as a necessary step in achieving net-zero emissions.

" What is the significance of the UK Government's classification of nuclear as ""environmentally sustainable"" for the adoption of small modular reactors (SMRs)?

","['In the Spring Budget, the Chancellor confirmed nuclear as “ environmentally sustainable ” removing an element of uncertainty which will enable the UK to plan and finance nuclear energy infrastructure in the long term. However, building confidence in technology and equipment will be key for the UK Government in delivering new nuclear power generation.', 'The perception of nuclear technology by both investors and the general public is largely based on well-known and highly publicised international events – most notably, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the more recent 2011 accident in Fukushima. Both of these incidents were preventable, had international best practice and standards been observed.', 'In the past 10 years, however, there has been a slow but positive shift in the perception of nuclear energy by the UK public. In 2012, only 9% strongly supported the technology and 29% supported its use for electricity generation. According to Statista, this increased to 18% strongly supporting and 24% supporting by 2022 and, those opposing or strongly opposing, dropping from 27% in 2012 to 13% in 2022.', 'The recent energy crisis has further driven positive sentiment toward the technology. A 2023 survey found a 25% increase in net support for new nuclear power since June 2021, with support growing across every age group and nation across the UK.', 'This shift in perception will be bolstered by the Government’ s classification of nuclear as “ environmentally sustainable ”. This is particularly important when considering the benefits that small modular reactors ( SMRs) could offer the UK’ s electricity network, another focus of the Spring Budget.', 'Smaller-scale power plants offer the potential to leverage modular off-site manufacturing for flexible deployment, but most importantly, they require less water for cooling and can therefore be located further inland than typical nuclear energy facilities.

Whether this will be the Rolls Royce SMR initially proposed at three sites, or one of the other available technologies, there will be a need to ensure that the UK has the manufacturing capability, innovation and skills necessary to capitalise on this opportunity.', 'As with any emerging technology, there is an abundance of caution around the use of SMRs, from the Government and investors, but particularly the general public who know little about the technology.', 'The nuclear industry is already highly regulated, but energy companies can go further to help build confidence to garner the support of stakeholder, investors and the general public.

It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," Alkaline electrolysis (AEL) is the most widely used type of electrolysis in industrial applications, but it comes with some drawbacks. These include lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency, which can make it difficult to achieve the high standards required for fuel cell vehicles and industrial applications, such as concentrations of less than 5 ppm of oxygen and 5 ppm of water. To overcome these challenges, further optimisation is needed to improve the process and remove contaminants.",https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/447538/turning-the-green-hydrogen-dream-into-reality/

" What are the main challenges in producing green hydrogen at a large scale and making it commercially viable?

","['The challenges to making green hydrogen production commercially viable can be tackled if the right technology and economic infrastructure are in place, writes Maria Anez-Lingerfelt, senior scientist at Pall Corporation.', 'The demand for new green energy strategies is increasing and hydrogen is regarded as a key factor in meeting international emissions targets and achieving net zero by 2050. The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks.', 'In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," The main challenges in producing green hydrogen at a large scale and making it commercially viable include the need for increased power capacity from renewable energy sources, such as wind farms and solar plants, to power the electrolysis process, and the optimization of the production process using electrolysers. Additionally, the offline processes, such as filtration, separation, and purification, require several unit operations to achieve the required purity levels, which can be costly and technically challenging, particularly when it comes to meeting stringent regulations around gas purity specifications.",https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/447538/turning-the-green-hydrogen-dream-into-reality/

Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement.', 'Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good.', 'Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption.

" To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, what are some of the major technical challenges that need to be overcome, such as mentioned in the text?

","['The challenges to making green hydrogen production commercially viable can be tackled if the right technology and economic infrastructure are in place, writes Maria Anez-Lingerfelt, senior scientist at Pall Corporation.', 'The demand for new green energy strategies is increasing and hydrogen is regarded as a key factor in meeting international emissions targets and achieving net zero by 2050. The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks.', 'In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," The major technical challenges to making green hydrogen commercially viable at scale include:

1. Increasing the power capacity from wind farms and solar plants to sustain the energy required for electrolysis.
2. Optimizing the production process using electrolysers to improve efficiency and lower costs.
3. Removing solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants from the hydrogen stream to meet stringent purity specifications (typically 2,000-6,000 ppm of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water).
4. Cooling the liquid/gas mixture without incurring significant cost implications (up to 5% of the total system outlay).
5. Separating liquid contaminants using gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators, and liquid/gas coalescers, while preventing liquid re-entrainment.
6. Removing solid contaminants, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH), from the process, and potentially using disposable gas filters with narrow micron ratings.",https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/447538/turning-the-green-hydrogen-dream-into-reality/
" Can the use of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the pulp and paper sector in Canada be seen as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement efforts, and if so, how can this misconception be addressed?

","['Carbon capture and storage ( CCS) has long been touted as part of the solution to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.', 'Fast forward to 2023 and global policy experts increasingly identify CCS as an essential part of the global path to maintaining the Paris Agreement’ s target of limiting global temperate rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.', 'One of the persistent arguments against the use of CCS is that it will prolong the transition away from the use of fossil fuels and thereby prolong the ‘ fossil fuel age’. Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement.', 'Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good.', 'Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.', 'This may be because climate change is impacting Canada’ s forests or because policy makers decide that in order to meet the world’ s Paris commitments, all CO2 emissions need to be treated equally.', 'As a result, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is having to look to bioenergy with CCS ( or BECCS). This is not because it is seeking to avoid abatement but rather because it was an early adopter of clean technologies and now has limited viable options to reduce emissions further.', 'Implementing BECCS is the most economically and technologically feasible pathway to further emissions reductions of total carbon at many Canadian pulp and paper facilities. As forest management practices continue to improve to maximise the carbon sequestered in Canada’ s forests and long-lived wood products, there is also a realistic potential for the use of BECCS to contribute to the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere and become a negative emissions technology ( NET).', 'It is widely accepted, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC), that the use of NETs will be essential to meet our commitment to 1.5C.', 'At this juncture in the race to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there is no silver bullet.']"," No, this perception is an ""erroneous"" one, according to the text. The pulp and paper sector in Canada was actually one of the first adopters of clean technologies and has achieved significant emissions reductions, primarily through the use of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). In fact, the sector is now looking to implement BECCS due to limited viable options for further emissions reductions, and it is seen as a crucial strategy to meet Canada's Paris Agreement commitments, both in the short- to medium-term and long-term, including the ultimate goal of reaching ""negative emissions technology"" (NET).",https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/482131/carbon-abatement-or-ccs-the-answer-is-both/

" What has contributed to a positive shift in the perception of nuclear energy in the UK, particularly among the general public?

","['In the Spring Budget, the Chancellor confirmed nuclear as “ environmentally sustainable ” removing an element of uncertainty which will enable the UK to plan and finance nuclear energy infrastructure in the long term. However, building confidence in technology and equipment will be key for the UK Government in delivering new nuclear power generation.', 'The perception of nuclear technology by both investors and the general public is largely based on well-known and highly publicised international events – most notably, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the more recent 2011 accident in Fukushima. Both of these incidents were preventable, had international best practice and standards been observed.', 'In the past 10 years, however, there has been a slow but positive shift in the perception of nuclear energy by the UK public. In 2012, only 9% strongly supported the technology and 29% supported its use for electricity generation. According to Statista, this increased to 18% strongly supporting and 24% supporting by 2022 and, those opposing or strongly opposing, dropping from 27% in 2012 to 13% in 2022.', 'The recent energy crisis has further driven positive sentiment toward the technology. A 2023 survey found a 25% increase in net support for new nuclear power since June 2021, with support growing across every age group and nation across the UK.', 'This shift in perception will be bolstered by the Government’ s classification of nuclear as “ environmentally sustainable ”. This is particularly important when considering the benefits that small modular reactors ( SMRs) could offer the UK’ s electricity network, another focus of the Spring Budget.', 'Smaller-scale power plants offer the potential to leverage modular off-site manufacturing for flexible deployment, but most importantly, they require less water for cooling and can therefore be located further inland than typical nuclear energy facilities.

" What are the main technical challenges in producing green hydrogen at scale, and what technologies are being developed to overcome them?

","['The challenges to making green hydrogen production commercially viable can be tackled if the right technology and economic infrastructure are in place, writes Maria Anez-Lingerfelt, senior scientist at Pall Corporation.', 'The demand for new green energy strategies is increasing and hydrogen is regarded as a key factor in meeting international emissions targets and achieving net zero by 2050. The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks.', 'In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026.', 'In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas.', 'The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges.', 'International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify.', 'So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen.', 'Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process.', 'The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes.', 'There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation.', 'Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality.', 'This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels.', 'Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications.', 'To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.']"," The main technical challenges in producing green hydrogen at scale include purifying it to meet stringent regulations, producing it efficiently, and reducing costs. To overcome these challenges, various technologies are being developed, including the use of different types of electrolysers such as alkaline electrolysis, polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis (PEM), and solid oxide electrolysis (SOEC). Additionally, the process involves various unit operations such as filtration, separation, and purification to remove contaminants, and technologies like gravity separators, mist eliminators, filter vane separators, and liquid/gas coalescers.",https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/447538/turning-the-green-hydrogen-dream-into-reality/
" Can the use of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology in Canada's pulp and paper sector be seen as a detrimental threat to reducing greenhouse gas emissions when the sector is trying to transition away from fossil fuels?

","['Carbon capture and storage ( CCS) has long been touted as part of the solution to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.', 'Fast forward to 2023 and global policy experts increasingly identify CCS as an essential part of the global path to maintaining the Paris Agreement’ s target of limiting global temperate rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.', 'One of the persistent arguments against the use of CCS is that it will prolong the transition away from the use of fossil fuels and thereby prolong the ‘ fossil fuel age’. Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation.', 'Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement.', 'Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good.', 'Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline.', 'The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited.', 'The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas.', 'Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced.', 'Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees.', 'While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.', 'This may be because climate change is impacting Canada’ s forests or because policy makers decide that in order to meet the world’ s Paris commitments, all CO2 emissions need to be treated equally.', 'As a result, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is having to look to bioenergy with CCS ( or BECCS). This is not because it is seeking to avoid abatement but rather because it was an early adopter of clean technologies and now has limited viable options to reduce emissions further.', 'Implementing BECCS is the most economically and technologically feasible pathway to further emissions reductions of total carbon at many Canadian pulp and paper facilities. As forest management practices continue to improve to maximise the carbon sequestered in Canada’ s forests and long-lived wood products, there is also a realistic potential for the use of BECCS to contribute to the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere and become a negative emissions technology ( NET).', 'It is widely accepted, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC), that the use of NETs will be essential to meet our commitment to 1.5C.', 'At this juncture in the race to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there is no silver bullet.']"," No, according to the text, CCS technology is not a threat to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even in the pulp and paper sector. In fact, BCFS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) can be a pathway for further emissions reductions, and is considered an essential technology for meeting the Paris Agreement's target of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C, and is seen as a means to achieve negative emissions (NET) technology and draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/482131/carbon-abatement-or-ccs-the-answer-is-both/

However, building confidence in technology and equipment will be key for the UK Government in delivering new nuclear power generation.', 'The perception of nuclear technology by both investors and the general public is largely based on well-known and highly publicised international events – most notably, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the more recent 2011 accident in Fukushima. Both of these incidents were preventable, had international best practice and standards been observed.', 'In the past 10 years, however, there has been a slow but positive shift in the perception of nuclear energy by the UK public. In 2012, only 9% strongly supported the technology and 29% supported its use for electricity generation. According to Statista, this increased to 18% strongly supporting and 24% supporting by 2022 and, those opposing or strongly opposing, dropping from 27% in 2012 to 13% in 2022.', 'The recent energy crisis has further driven positive sentiment toward the technology.

This is particularly important when considering the benefits that small modular reactors ( SMRs) could offer the UK’ s electricity network, another focus of the Spring Budget.', 'Smaller-scale power plants offer the potential to leverage modular off-site manufacturing for flexible deployment, but most importantly, they require less water for cooling and can therefore be located further inland than typical nuclear energy facilities. This means that SMRs could be located closer to where the energy demand is higher – reducing the amount of infrastructure required to transfer energy to where it is needed.', 'The UK Government has launched “ Great British Nuclear ” with a mission to identify the best small modular reactor ( SMR) technology for the UK. Whether this will be the Rolls Royce SMR initially proposed at three sites, or one of the other available technologies, there will be a need to ensure that the UK has the manufacturing capability, innovation and skills necessary to capitalise on this opportunity.', 'As with any emerging technology, there is an abundance of caution around the use of SMRs, from the Government and investors, but particularly the general public who know little about the technology.', 'The nuclear industry is already highly regulated, but energy companies can go further to help build confidence to garner the support of stakeholder, investors and the general public.

The report included contributions from solar industry leaders in technology, financing, and insurance.', '“ To meet renewable energy deployment goals, the focus needs to be on smart growth – relying on data to inform decisions and utilizing resilience measures to protect assets, ” said kWh Analytics chief executive officer Jason Kaminsky.', 'The report identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather and operational risks. For the first time this year, battery energy storage-related risks were included. This news covers the extreme weather risks, with subsequent articles reviewing operational and storage-related risks.', 'Data from kWh Analytics found that risk modeling for damage from weather events has been heavily overlooked. Particularly in large solar markets like California, Texas and Arizona, actual ground-up losses from weather events have been as much as 300% or more than what has been modeled by asset owners.', 'kWh Analytics said that as PV is a relatively new asset class, natural catastrophe models typically used to size insurance premiums often rely on proxy structures to estimate losses. The company said more accurate PV-specific modeling is needed, and differences in technology used ( like trackers with hail-stow protection) should be considered in risk modeling.', 'The insurance provider has developed new models leveraging locational-specific risks, backed by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), significant loss data and satellite imagery to provide a more accurate risk assessment.', 'Reliability testing from Kiwa PVEL found that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect. No module tested by PVEL lost more than 3% production after undergoing a hail stress sequence.', 'The testing lab said that rather than relying on expensive electroluminescent ( EL) testing, it would recommend that asset owners perform annual aerial thermal scans to identify cracked modules that have developed hotspots and are at risk for fires and in need of replacement. Fire risks are most severe in the rare case that a module with a failed bypass diode has cracked cells.', 'Modules protected by hail stow post only 0.8% power loss', 'Waaree found that lab-tested solar modules that tilt to a stowed position to protect from direct hail impacts only lose 0.8% of their production from being in a sub-optimal angle during hail events. In turn, the modules were able to avoid damage altogether by stowing. The losses perform far better than the IEC standard of 5% losses from stowing.', 'Data from Alliant Power found that assets in high-risk areas can reduce insurance costs by up to 50% by investing in resilience measures like selecting heat-tempered panels and trackers that enable hail stowing.', '“ It pays to take time to differentiate your project and select highly qualified partners when it comes to risk and insurance, ” said Alliant Insurance Services.', 'Natural catastrophe events are on the rise, with billion-dollar weather events increasing from an average of 13 per year in the 2010s to an average of 22 per year in the 2020s, with 28 billion-dollar damage weather events occurring in 2023 alone, said Alliant.', 'Solar developer Longroad Energy shared a case study under which different tilt angles and their impact on module protection from hail impacts were assessed. The report was based on data from RETC and tracker provider Nextracker.', 'It found that a 50-degree stow led to a 33% estimated module breakage probability, while 60-degree stow had an 8% probability, and 75-degree stow led to only a 1% risk of breakage from hail.', 'The next report in this series will review the kWh Analytics assessment of solar asset operational risks.', 'For more on quality issues in utility-scale solar, sign up for a free webinar on Racking and trackers: quality issues in the factory and design considerations for utility-scale solar installations, June 11 at 11 a.m. ET.

" What new policy is Greece planning to implement to support the growth of energy storage in the country?

","['Greece’ s energy storage market is hot with a number of new policies paving the way to new applications in the market. The government is now working a new plan, which will allow the colocation of batteries with existing solar plants as well as standalone, in front of the meter battery energy storage systems.', 'Last year, Greece generated 57% of its electricity demand via renewable energies. This year the country is expected to score an even higher percentage of renewable electricity, although this success is accompanied by the thorny issue of curtailing surplus green electricity at times when the electricity system can not accommodate it. Therefore, rather belatedly, Greece has turned its attention to energy storage.', 'So far, the country is running a 1 GW program targeting standalone, front-of-the-meter batteries. Greece has already run two tenders awarding about 700 MW of battery storage projects. A call for the program’ s third tender, targeting specifically battery systems in former coal mining regions, is imminent. Awarded projects, under the 1 GW program, receive public subsidy support in the form of capital expenditure and operational expenditure subsidies.', 'Greece’ s minister of the environment and energy Theodoros Skylakakis told a local energy conference in Athens earlier in July that the country is blessed with exceptional renewable energy resources and in order to reap the benefits of it, it should speed up energy storage development.', 'In line with this, Skylakakis said that the ministry is working towards a plan that opens the battery storage market in two ways. Firstly, allowing the colocation of behind-the-meter batteries along existing photovoltaic plants. And secondly, allowing new standalone, in front of the meter batteries without public subsidy support.', 'Both policies might prove important milestones in the country’ s energy transition plan.

" What is the predicted global renewable capacity to be driven by government tenders in 2024?
","['Analysis from research firm Wood Mackenzie shows solar remained the most awarded form of renewable energy in government tenders last year, but its share of total volume dropped from 59% to 44%. In 2024, government tenders are predicted to at least match 2023 levels.', 'Research firm Wood Mackeznie says renewable capacity reached 137 GW through government tenders in 2023.', 'A 10% increase year on year, Wood Mackenzie says the growth came “ despite sector cost headwinds, logistics tensions, and the energy crisis ” in 2023.', 'PV capacity was the most awarded form of renewable energy through government tenders last year. The Asia-Pacific region received two-thirds of government contracts worldwide, at approximately 90 GW. This was buoyed by China, where more than 55 GW were allocated through 49 renewable energy tenders. India awarded 20 GW over 55 tenders, while Germany was the largest player in Europe, with 19 GW awarded through 11 rounds.', 'Wood Mackenzie is now predicting government tenders will drive at least 102 GW of global renewable capacity in 2024, including at least 60 GW of offshore wind. It anticipates that the overall volume will grow as the year progresses, eventually matching 2023 levels.', '“ Tenders have increased each year, and Wood Mackenzie expects to see some big rewards in 2024 – the EMEA region will hold more than 50% of expected tenders, mostly for offshore wind capacity, ” said Ana Fernandez Garcia, a senior research analyst at the firm. “ Individual major markets, such as China, will continue to dominate. ”', 'WoodMac’ s analysis says renewable energy tenders are currently experiencing two opposing trends. It explains that while the offshore wind energy sector has witnessed “ intense competition, ” resulting in subsidy-free tenders and negative bids, onshore and solar energy tenders have gone undersubscribed.', 'The research firm says the lack of interested bidders left 30% of the tendered volume unallocated in 2023. It adds that zero bidding has led to canceling contracts later in the developing phase of projects.', 'Fernandez Garcia says both situations put renewables deployment at risk and illustrate the need for tender design reform. She adds that Wood Mackenzie expects an increase in ceiling prices and non-price criteria to play a prominent role in the year ahead.', 'Wood Mackenzie’ s latest analysis follows recent research on the levelized cost of electricity ( LCOE) in the Asia-Pacific region, and predictions for annual PV growth through 2032, both published earlier this year.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

" What milestone has ION Storage Systems achieved with its solid-state battery, marking significant progress towards commercialization?

","['The US solid-state battery developer announced it has achieved 800 cycles with its battery, marking significant progress towards commercialization. If this trend continues, the development holds promising potential for grid-scale projects.', 'ION Storage Systems has reached the 800-cycle mark with its solid-state battery, which it plans to bring into commercial production. The battery previously exceeded 125 cycles with less than five percent capacity loss in March, 2024.', 'The milestone of 800 cycles was achieved without encountering the common issues that can complicate the market readiness of solid-state batteries. The battery, which uses a ceramic electrolyte separator was tested without compression and showed no signs of swelling or volume change.', 'It means the battery will not require compression, swell budget, an extensive cooling system, or heavy fire barriers when rolled out, according to ION.', 'Neil Ovadia, VP of Supply Chain at ION, spoke with ESS News about the company’ s progress following previous coverage in 2022.', '“ The last two years have been transformational. We’ ve grown from about 20 employees to over 75, expanded into two larger buildings, and broken ground on our pilot manufacturing facility, ” said Ovadia.', '“ We’ re focused on the defense and consumer products markets initially, with plans to transition into electric vehicles and grid storage as we reduce costs and increase energy density, ” he added.', 'The technical achievement of the battery itself was the real highlight, according to Ovadia.', '“ We’ ve made big strides in our product’ s cycle life. We went from proving 125 cycles in March to achieving 800 cycles by July. Importantly, these cycles were achieved at room temperature with no compression or additional aids, demonstrating the true potential of our solid-state technology, ” he said.', 'Robert Whittelsey, Principal Technical Program Manager at ION, told ESS News the technical process behind the testing, and highlighted the significance.', '“ 800 cycles is significant because that’ s beyond most consumer electronics. That starts to get into EV and grid storage applications, and even space-based applications that require a high cycle life. So this is something that could be used for all applications. ”', 'Ovadia added, “ It’ s a confluence of all the characteristics of that battery that got to 800 cycles. One thing that you find in solid-state batteries is this requirement for compression, this requirement for heat, this coddling of the battery to achieve those cycles. It’ s meaningful when you look at it as a final product, it makes it more expensive, heavier, and takes away from the potential and promise of a solid-sate battery.', 'ION’ s advancements with its solid-state batteries are highly relevant for grid-scale applications, with the company recently awarded $ 20 million from the US government’ s ARPA-E Scale-Up program, which aims to accelerate the development of larger format cells for grid storage.', 'Ovadia said, “ We are focused on scaling up our technology to produce larger, more cost-effective batteries. This involves collaborating with manufacturing partners and leveraging our university research partnerships to enhance both the mechanical and electrochemical aspects of our technology. ”', 'He further emphasized the robustness and safety of their technology, stating, “ Our batteries are inherently safer, eliminating the risk of fires associated with lithium-ion batteries. This makes them ideal for large-scale energy storage deployments where safety is paramount. ”', 'Whittelsey added, “ Our technology is not only safer but also more efficient in various temperature conditions. Traditional lithium-ion batteries require significant infrastructure to maintain optimal temperatures, which incurs additional costs. Our batteries can operate effectively across a broader temperature range, reducing the need for such infrastructure. ”', 'Ovadia said that the current BESS grid infrastructure generally consumes energy as a parasitic draw for cooling, something that can be eliminated with the ability to operate at higher temperatures without the dangers of lithium-ion batteries.', 'Furthermore, Whittelsey pointed out the recyclability of the solution over traditional battery products with graphite anodes.', 'ION recently secured a supply agreement and investment from Saint-Gobain in late 2023, one of the world’ s largest ceramics, glass and material suppliers to boost its manufacturing capabilities.', '“ We are working with several other large multinational partners to produce significant quantities at gigawatt-hour scales and achieve global reach in manufacturing, ” Neil said, adding that further “ significant announcements ” from the company are due in the coming quarters.', 'The relatively early-stage company previously raised $ 8 million in 2019, and $ 31 million Series A funding in 2022.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

" What is causing a significant increase in the curtailment of solar energy in California?

","['Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity.', 'Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

","['The report from kWh Analytics, with input from several industry leaders, identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather, such as hail, and operational risks.', 'A report from kWh Analytics, a climate insurance provider, released its 6th annual Solar Risk Assessment report, providing a data-driven overview of risks to solar assets. The report included contributions from solar industry leaders in technology, financing, and insurance.', '“ To meet renewable energy deployment goals, the focus needs to be on smart growth – relying on data to inform decisions and utilizing resilience measures to protect assets, ” said kWh Analytics chief executive officer Jason Kaminsky.', 'The report identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather and operational risks. For the first time this year, battery energy storage-related risks were included. This news covers the extreme weather risks, with subsequent articles reviewing operational and storage-related risks.', 'Data from kWh Analytics found that risk modeling for damage from weather events has been heavily overlooked. Particularly in large solar markets like California, Texas and Arizona, actual ground-up losses from weather events have been as much as 300% or more than what has been modeled by asset owners.', 'kWh Analytics said that as PV is a relatively new asset class, natural catastrophe models typically used to size insurance premiums often rely on proxy structures to estimate losses. The company said more accurate PV-specific modeling is needed, and differences in technology used ( like trackers with hail-stow protection) should be considered in risk modeling.', 'The insurance provider has developed new models leveraging locational-specific risks, backed by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), significant loss data and satellite imagery to provide a more accurate risk assessment.', 'Reliability testing from Kiwa PVEL found that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect. No module tested by PVEL lost more than 3% production after undergoing a hail stress sequence.', 'The testing lab said that rather than relying on expensive electroluminescent ( EL) testing, it would recommend that asset owners perform annual aerial thermal scans to identify cracked modules that have developed hotspots and are at risk for fires and in need of replacement.

The government is now working a new plan, which will allow the colocation of batteries with existing solar plants as well as standalone, in front of the meter battery energy storage systems.', 'Last year, Greece generated 57% of its electricity demand via renewable energies. This year the country is expected to score an even higher percentage of renewable electricity, although this success is accompanied by the thorny issue of curtailing surplus green electricity at times when the electricity system can not accommodate it. Therefore, rather belatedly, Greece has turned its attention to energy storage.', 'So far, the country is running a 1 GW program targeting standalone, front-of-the-meter batteries. Greece has already run two tenders awarding about 700 MW of battery storage projects. A call for the program’ s third tender, targeting specifically battery systems in former coal mining regions, is imminent. Awarded projects, under the 1 GW program, receive public subsidy support in the form of capital expenditure and operational expenditure subsidies.', 'Greece’ s minister of the environment and energy Theodoros Skylakakis told a local energy conference in Athens earlier in July that the country is blessed with exceptional renewable energy resources and in order to reap the benefits of it, it should speed up energy storage development.', 'In line with this, Skylakakis said that the ministry is working towards a plan that opens the battery storage market in two ways.

The Asia-Pacific region received two-thirds of government contracts worldwide, at approximately 90 GW. This was buoyed by China, where more than 55 GW were allocated through 49 renewable energy tenders. India awarded 20 GW over 55 tenders, while Germany was the largest player in Europe, with 19 GW awarded through 11 rounds.', 'Wood Mackenzie is now predicting government tenders will drive at least 102 GW of global renewable capacity in 2024, including at least 60 GW of offshore wind. It anticipates that the overall volume will grow as the year progresses, eventually matching 2023 levels.', '“ Tenders have increased each year, and Wood Mackenzie expects to see some big rewards in 2024 – the EMEA region will hold more than 50% of expected tenders, mostly for offshore wind capacity, ” said Ana Fernandez Garcia, a senior research analyst at the firm. “ Individual major markets, such as China, will continue to dominate. ”', 'WoodMac’ s analysis says renewable energy tenders are currently experiencing two opposing trends. It explains that while the offshore wind energy sector has witnessed “ intense competition, ” resulting in subsidy-free tenders and negative bids, onshore and solar energy tenders have gone undersubscribed.', 'The research firm says the lack of interested bidders left 30% of the tendered volume unallocated in 2023. It adds that zero bidding has led to canceling contracts later in the developing phase of projects.', 'Fernandez Garcia says both situations put renewables deployment at risk and illustrate the need for tender design reform. She adds that Wood Mackenzie expects an increase in ceiling prices and non-price criteria to play a prominent role in the year ahead.', 'Wood Mackenzie’ s latest analysis follows recent research on the levelized cost of electricity ( LCOE) in the Asia-Pacific region, and predictions for annual PV growth through 2032, both published earlier this year.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

" What is the significant milestone achieved by ION Storage Systems in its solid-state battery development?
","['The US solid-state battery developer announced it has achieved 800 cycles with its battery, marking significant progress towards commercialization. If this trend continues, the development holds promising potential for grid-scale projects.', 'ION Storage Systems has reached the 800-cycle mark with its solid-state battery, which it plans to bring into commercial production. The battery previously exceeded 125 cycles with less than five percent capacity loss in March, 2024.', 'The milestone of 800 cycles was achieved without encountering the common issues that can complicate the market readiness of solid-state batteries. The battery, which uses a ceramic electrolyte separator was tested without compression and showed no signs of swelling or volume change.', 'It means the battery will not require compression, swell budget, an extensive cooling system, or heavy fire barriers when rolled out, according to ION.', 'Neil Ovadia, VP of Supply Chain at ION, spoke with ESS News about the company’ s progress following previous coverage in 2022.', '“ The last two years have been transformational. We’ ve grown from about 20 employees to over 75, expanded into two larger buildings, and broken ground on our pilot manufacturing facility, ” said Ovadia.', '“ We’ re focused on the defense and consumer products markets initially, with plans to transition into electric vehicles and grid storage as we reduce costs and increase energy density, ” he added.', 'The technical achievement of the battery itself was the real highlight, according to Ovadia.', '“ We’ ve made big strides in our product’ s cycle life. We went from proving 125 cycles in March to achieving 800 cycles by July. Importantly, these cycles were achieved at room temperature with no compression or additional aids, demonstrating the true potential of our solid-state technology, ” he said.', 'Robert Whittelsey, Principal Technical Program Manager at ION, told ESS News the technical process behind the testing, and highlighted the significance.', '“ 800 cycles is significant because that’ s beyond most consumer electronics. That starts to get into EV and grid storage applications, and even space-based applications that require a high cycle life. So this is something that could be used for all applications. ”', 'Ovadia added, “ It’ s a confluence of all the characteristics of that battery that got to 800 cycles. One thing that you find in solid-state batteries is this requirement for compression, this requirement for heat, this coddling of the battery to achieve those cycles. It’ s meaningful when you look at it as a final product, it makes it more expensive, heavier, and takes away from the potential and promise of a solid-sate battery.', 'ION’ s advancements with its solid-state batteries are highly relevant for grid-scale applications, with the company recently awarded $ 20 million from the US government’ s ARPA-E Scale-Up program, which aims to accelerate the development of larger format cells for grid storage.', 'Ovadia said, “ We are focused on scaling up our technology to produce larger, more cost-effective batteries. This involves collaborating with manufacturing partners and leveraging our university research partnerships to enhance both the mechanical and electrochemical aspects of our technology. ”', 'He further emphasized the robustness and safety of their technology, stating, “ Our batteries are inherently safer, eliminating the risk of fires associated with lithium-ion batteries. This makes them ideal for large-scale energy storage deployments where safety is paramount. ”', 'Whittelsey added, “ Our technology is not only safer but also more efficient in various temperature conditions. Traditional lithium-ion batteries require significant infrastructure to maintain optimal temperatures, which incurs additional costs. Our batteries can operate effectively across a broader temperature range, reducing the need for such infrastructure. ”', 'Ovadia said that the current BESS grid infrastructure generally consumes energy as a parasitic draw for cooling, something that can be eliminated with the ability to operate at higher temperatures without the dangers of lithium-ion batteries.', 'Furthermore, Whittelsey pointed out the recyclability of the solution over traditional battery products with graphite anodes.', 'ION recently secured a supply agreement and investment from Saint-Gobain in late 2023, one of the world’ s largest ceramics, glass and material suppliers to boost its manufacturing capabilities.', '“ We are working with several other large multinational partners to produce significant quantities at gigawatt-hour scales and achieve global reach in manufacturing, ” Neil said, adding that further “ significant announcements ” from the company are due in the coming quarters.', 'The relatively early-stage company previously raised $ 8 million in 2019, and $ 31 million Series A funding in 2022.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

" What is curtailment of solar generation, and why is it a significant issue in California?

","['Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity.', 'Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand.

The report included contributions from solar industry leaders in technology, financing, and insurance.', '“ To meet renewable energy deployment goals, the focus needs to be on smart growth – relying on data to inform decisions and utilizing resilience measures to protect assets, ” said kWh Analytics chief executive officer Jason Kaminsky.', 'The report identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather and operational risks. For the first time this year, battery energy storage-related risks were included. This news covers the extreme weather risks, with subsequent articles reviewing operational and storage-related risks.', 'Data from kWh Analytics found that risk modeling for damage from weather events has been heavily overlooked. Particularly in large solar markets like California, Texas and Arizona, actual ground-up losses from weather events have been as much as 300% or more than what has been modeled by asset owners.', 'kWh Analytics said that as PV is a relatively new asset class, natural catastrophe models typically used to size insurance premiums often rely on proxy structures to estimate losses. The company said more accurate PV-specific modeling is needed, and differences in technology used ( like trackers with hail-stow protection) should be considered in risk modeling.', 'The insurance provider has developed new models leveraging locational-specific risks, backed by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), significant loss data and satellite imagery to provide a more accurate risk assessment.', 'Reliability testing from Kiwa PVEL found that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect. No module tested by PVEL lost more than 3% production after undergoing a hail stress sequence.', 'The testing lab said that rather than relying on expensive electroluminescent ( EL) testing, it would recommend that asset owners perform annual aerial thermal scans to identify cracked modules that have developed hotspots and are at risk for fires and in need of replacement. Fire risks are most severe in the rare case that a module with a failed bypass diode has cracked cells.', 'Modules protected by hail stow post only 0.8% power loss', 'Waaree found that lab-tested solar modules that tilt to a stowed position to protect from direct hail impacts only lose 0.8% of their production from being in a sub-optimal angle during hail events. In turn, the modules were able to avoid damage altogether by stowing. The losses perform far better than the IEC standard of 5% losses from stowing.', 'Data from Alliant Power found that assets in high-risk areas can reduce insurance costs by up to 50% by investing in resilience measures like selecting heat-tempered panels and trackers that enable hail stowing.', '“ It pays to take time to differentiate your project and select highly qualified partners when it comes to risk and insurance, ” said Alliant Insurance Services.', 'Natural catastrophe events are on the rise, with billion-dollar weather events increasing from an average of 13 per year in the 2010s to an average of 22 per year in the 2020s, with 28 billion-dollar damage weather events occurring in 2023 alone, said Alliant.', 'Solar developer Longroad Energy shared a case study under which different tilt angles and their impact on module protection from hail impacts were assessed.

" What is significant about the achievement of 800 cycles by ION's solid-state battery, and how does it compare to other battery technologies?

","['The US solid-state battery developer announced it has achieved 800 cycles with its battery, marking significant progress towards commercialization. If this trend continues, the development holds promising potential for grid-scale projects.', 'ION Storage Systems has reached the 800-cycle mark with its solid-state battery, which it plans to bring into commercial production. The battery previously exceeded 125 cycles with less than five percent capacity loss in March, 2024.', 'The milestone of 800 cycles was achieved without encountering the common issues that can complicate the market readiness of solid-state batteries. The battery, which uses a ceramic electrolyte separator was tested without compression and showed no signs of swelling or volume change.', 'It means the battery will not require compression, swell budget, an extensive cooling system, or heavy fire barriers when rolled out, according to ION.', 'Neil Ovadia, VP of Supply Chain at ION, spoke with ESS News about the company’ s progress following previous coverage in 2022.', '“ The last two years have been transformational. We’ ve grown from about 20 employees to over 75, expanded into two larger buildings, and broken ground on our pilot manufacturing facility, ” said Ovadia.', '“ We’ re focused on the defense and consumer products markets initially, with plans to transition into electric vehicles and grid storage as we reduce costs and increase energy density, ” he added.', 'The technical achievement of the battery itself was the real highlight, according to Ovadia.', '“ We’ ve made big strides in our product’ s cycle life. We went from proving 125 cycles in March to achieving 800 cycles by July. Importantly, these cycles were achieved at room temperature with no compression or additional aids, demonstrating the true potential of our solid-state technology, ” he said.', 'Robert Whittelsey, Principal Technical Program Manager at ION, told ESS News the technical process behind the testing, and highlighted the significance.', '“ 800 cycles is significant because that’ s beyond most consumer electronics. That starts to get into EV and grid storage applications, and even space-based applications that require a high cycle life. So this is something that could be used for all applications. ”', 'Ovadia added, “ It’ s a confluence of all the characteristics of that battery that got to 800 cycles. One thing that you find in solid-state batteries is this requirement for compression, this requirement for heat, this coddling of the battery to achieve those cycles. It’ s meaningful when you look at it as a final product, it makes it more expensive, heavier, and takes away from the potential and promise of a solid-sate battery.', 'ION’ s advancements with its solid-state batteries are highly relevant for grid-scale applications, with the company recently awarded $ 20 million from the US government’ s ARPA-E Scale-Up program, which aims to accelerate the development of larger format cells for grid storage.', 'Ovadia said, “ We are focused on scaling up our technology to produce larger, more cost-effective batteries. This involves collaborating with manufacturing partners and leveraging our university research partnerships to enhance both the mechanical and electrochemical aspects of our technology. ”', 'He further emphasized the robustness and safety of their technology, stating, “ Our batteries are inherently safer, eliminating the risk of fires associated with lithium-ion batteries. This makes them ideal for large-scale energy storage deployments where safety is paramount. ”', 'Whittelsey added, “ Our technology is not only safer but also more efficient in various temperature conditions. Traditional lithium-ion batteries require significant infrastructure to maintain optimal temperatures, which incurs additional costs. Our batteries can operate effectively across a broader temperature range, reducing the need for such infrastructure. ”', 'Ovadia said that the current BESS grid infrastructure generally consumes energy as a parasitic draw for cooling, something that can be eliminated with the ability to operate at higher temperatures without the dangers of lithium-ion batteries.', 'Furthermore, Whittelsey pointed out the recyclability of the solution over traditional battery products with graphite anodes.', 'ION recently secured a supply agreement and investment from Saint-Gobain in late 2023, one of the world’ s largest ceramics, glass and material suppliers to boost its manufacturing capabilities.', '“ We are working with several other large multinational partners to produce significant quantities at gigawatt-hour scales and achieve global reach in manufacturing, ” Neil said, adding that further “ significant announcements ” from the company are due in the coming quarters.', 'The relatively early-stage company previously raised $ 8 million in 2019, and $ 31 million Series A funding in 2022.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

" What is the target amount of renewable energy generation capacity that the Quebec government is seeking to develop through its tender process?

","['Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity.', 'Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

The report included contributions from solar industry leaders in technology, financing, and insurance.', '“ To meet renewable energy deployment goals, the focus needs to be on smart growth – relying on data to inform decisions and utilizing resilience measures to protect assets, ” said kWh Analytics chief executive officer Jason Kaminsky.', 'The report identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather and operational risks. For the first time this year, battery energy storage-related risks were included. This news covers the extreme weather risks, with subsequent articles reviewing operational and storage-related risks.', 'Data from kWh Analytics found that risk modeling for damage from weather events has been heavily overlooked. Particularly in large solar markets like California, Texas and Arizona, actual ground-up losses from weather events have been as much as 300% or more than what has been modeled by asset owners.', 'kWh Analytics said that as PV is a relatively new asset class, natural catastrophe models typically used to size insurance premiums often rely on proxy structures to estimate losses. The company said more accurate PV-specific modeling is needed, and differences in technology used ( like trackers with hail-stow protection) should be considered in risk modeling.', 'The insurance provider has developed new models leveraging locational-specific risks, backed by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), significant loss data and satellite imagery to provide a more accurate risk assessment.', 'Reliability testing from Kiwa PVEL found that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect. No module tested by PVEL lost more than 3% production after undergoing a hail stress sequence.', 'The testing lab said that rather than relying on expensive electroluminescent ( EL) testing, it would recommend that asset owners perform annual aerial thermal scans to identify cracked modules that have developed hotspots and are at risk for fires and in need of replacement. Fire risks are most severe in the rare case that a module with a failed bypass diode has cracked cells.', 'Modules protected by hail stow post only 0.8% power loss', 'Waaree found that lab-tested solar modules that tilt to a stowed position to protect from direct hail impacts only lose 0.8% of their production from being in a sub-optimal angle during hail events. In turn, the modules were able to avoid damage altogether by stowing. The losses perform far better than the IEC standard of 5% losses from stowing.', 'Data from Alliant Power found that assets in high-risk areas can reduce insurance costs by up to 50% by investing in resilience measures like selecting heat-tempered panels and trackers that enable hail stowing.', '“ It pays to take time to differentiate your project and select highly qualified partners when it comes to risk and insurance, ” said Alliant Insurance Services.', 'Natural catastrophe events are on the rise, with billion-dollar weather events increasing from an average of 13 per year in the 2010s to an average of 22 per year in the 2020s, with 28 billion-dollar damage weather events occurring in 2023 alone, said Alliant.', 'Solar developer Longroad Energy shared a case study under which different tilt angles and their impact on module protection from hail impacts were assessed.

If this trend continues, the development holds promising potential for grid-scale projects.', 'ION Storage Systems has reached the 800-cycle mark with its solid-state battery, which it plans to bring into commercial production. The battery previously exceeded 125 cycles with less than five percent capacity loss in March, 2024.', 'The milestone of 800 cycles was achieved without encountering the common issues that can complicate the market readiness of solid-state batteries. The battery, which uses a ceramic electrolyte separator was tested without compression and showed no signs of swelling or volume change.', 'It means the battery will not require compression, swell budget, an extensive cooling system, or heavy fire barriers when rolled out, according to ION.', 'Neil Ovadia, VP of Supply Chain at ION, spoke with ESS News about the company’ s progress following previous coverage in 2022.', '“ The last two years have been transformational. We’ ve grown from about 20 employees to over 75, expanded into two larger buildings, and broken ground on our pilot manufacturing facility, ” said Ovadia.', '“ We’ re focused on the defense and consumer products markets initially, with plans to transition into electric vehicles and grid storage as we reduce costs and increase energy density, ” he added.', 'The technical achievement of the battery itself was the real highlight, according to Ovadia.', '“ We’ ve made big strides in our product’ s cycle life. We went from proving 125 cycles in March to achieving 800 cycles by July. Importantly, these cycles were achieved at room temperature with no compression or additional aids, demonstrating the true potential of our solid-state technology, ” he said.', 'Robert Whittelsey, Principal Technical Program Manager at ION, told ESS News the technical process behind the testing, and highlighted the significance.', '“ 800 cycles is significant because that’ s beyond most consumer electronics. That starts to get into EV and grid storage applications, and even space-based applications that require a high cycle life. So this is something that could be used for all applications. ”', 'Ovadia added, “ It’ s a confluence of all the characteristics of that battery that got to 800 cycles. One thing that you find in solid-state batteries is this requirement for compression, this requirement for heat, this coddling of the battery to achieve those cycles. It’ s meaningful when you look at it as a final product, it makes it more expensive, heavier, and takes away from the potential and promise of a solid-sate battery.', 'ION’ s advancements with its solid-state batteries are highly relevant for grid-scale applications, with the company recently awarded $ 20 million from the US government’ s ARPA-E Scale-Up program, which aims to accelerate the development of larger format cells for grid storage.', 'Ovadia said, “ We are focused on scaling up our technology to produce larger, more cost-effective batteries. This involves collaborating with manufacturing partners and leveraging our university research partnerships to enhance both the mechanical and electrochemical aspects of our technology. ”', 'He further emphasized the robustness and safety of their technology, stating, “ Our batteries are inherently safer, eliminating the risk of fires associated with lithium-ion batteries. This makes them ideal for large-scale energy storage deployments where safety is paramount. ”', 'Whittelsey added, “ Our technology is not only safer but also more efficient in various temperature conditions. Traditional lithium-ion batteries require significant infrastructure to maintain optimal temperatures, which incurs additional costs. Our batteries can operate effectively across a broader temperature range, reducing the need for such infrastructure. ”', 'Ovadia said that the current BESS grid infrastructure generally consumes energy as a parasitic draw for cooling, something that can be eliminated with the ability to operate at higher temperatures without the dangers of lithium-ion batteries.', 'Furthermore, Whittelsey pointed out the recyclability of the solution over traditional battery products with graphite anodes.', 'ION recently secured a supply agreement and investment from Saint-Gobain in late 2023, one of the world’ s largest ceramics, glass and material suppliers to boost its manufacturing capabilities.', '“ We are working with several other large multinational partners to produce significant quantities at gigawatt-hour scales and achieve global reach in manufacturing, ” Neil said, adding that further “ significant announcements ” from the company are due in the coming quarters.', 'The relatively early-stage company previously raised $ 8 million in 2019, and $ 31 million Series A funding in 2022.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

","['Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity.', 'Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

For the first time this year, battery energy storage-related risks were included. This news covers the extreme weather risks, with subsequent articles reviewing operational and storage-related risks.', 'Data from kWh Analytics found that risk modeling for damage from weather events has been heavily overlooked. Particularly in large solar markets like California, Texas and Arizona, actual ground-up losses from weather events have been as much as 300% or more than what has been modeled by asset owners.', 'kWh Analytics said that as PV is a relatively new asset class, natural catastrophe models typically used to size insurance premiums often rely on proxy structures to estimate losses. The company said more accurate PV-specific modeling is needed, and differences in technology used ( like trackers with hail-stow protection) should be considered in risk modeling.', 'The insurance provider has developed new models leveraging locational-specific risks, backed by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), significant loss data and satellite imagery to provide a more accurate risk assessment.', 'Reliability testing from Kiwa PVEL found that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect. No module tested by PVEL lost more than 3% production after undergoing a hail stress sequence.', 'The testing lab said that rather than relying on expensive electroluminescent ( EL) testing, it would recommend that asset owners perform annual aerial thermal scans to identify cracked modules that have developed hotspots and are at risk for fires and in need of replacement. Fire risks are most severe in the rare case that a module with a failed bypass diode has cracked cells.', 'Modules protected by hail stow post only 0.8% power loss', 'Waaree found that lab-tested solar modules that tilt to a stowed position to protect from direct hail impacts only lose 0.8% of their production from being in a sub-optimal angle during hail events. In turn, the modules were able to avoid damage altogether by stowing. The losses perform far better than the IEC standard of 5% losses from stowing.', 'Data from Alliant Power found that assets in high-risk areas can reduce insurance costs by up to 50% by investing in resilience measures like selecting heat-tempered panels and trackers that enable hail stowing.', '“ It pays to take time to differentiate your project and select highly qualified partners when it comes to risk and insurance, ” said Alliant Insurance Services.', 'Natural catastrophe events are on the rise, with billion-dollar weather events increasing from an average of 13 per year in the 2010s to an average of 22 per year in the 2020s, with 28 billion-dollar damage weather events occurring in 2023 alone, said Alliant.', 'Solar developer Longroad Energy shared a case study under which different tilt angles and their impact on module protection from hail impacts were assessed. The report was based on data from RETC and tracker provider Nextracker.', 'It found that a 50-degree stow led to a 33% estimated module breakage probability, while 60-degree stow had an 8% probability, and 75-degree stow led to only a 1% risk of breakage from hail.', 'The next report in this series will review the kWh Analytics assessment of solar asset operational risks.', 'For more on quality issues in utility-scale solar, sign up for a free webinar on Racking and trackers: quality issues in the factory and design considerations for utility-scale solar installations, June 11 at 11 a.m. ET.

Importantly, these cycles were achieved at room temperature with no compression or additional aids, demonstrating the true potential of our solid-state technology, ” he said.', 'Robert Whittelsey, Principal Technical Program Manager at ION, told ESS News the technical process behind the testing, and highlighted the significance.', '“ 800 cycles is significant because that’ s beyond most consumer electronics. That starts to get into EV and grid storage applications, and even space-based applications that require a high cycle life. So this is something that could be used for all applications. ”', 'Ovadia added, “ It’ s a confluence of all the characteristics of that battery that got to 800 cycles. One thing that you find in solid-state batteries is this requirement for compression, this requirement for heat, this coddling of the battery to achieve those cycles. It’ s meaningful when you look at it as a final product, it makes it more expensive, heavier, and takes away from the potential and promise of a solid-sate battery.', 'ION’ s advancements with its solid-state batteries are highly relevant for grid-scale applications, with the company recently awarded $ 20 million from the US government’ s ARPA-E Scale-Up program, which aims to accelerate the development of larger format cells for grid storage.', 'Ovadia said, “ We are focused on scaling up our technology to produce larger, more cost-effective batteries. This involves collaborating with manufacturing partners and leveraging our university research partnerships to enhance both the mechanical and electrochemical aspects of our technology. ”', 'He further emphasized the robustness and safety of their technology, stating, “ Our batteries are inherently safer, eliminating the risk of fires associated with lithium-ion batteries. This makes them ideal for large-scale energy storage deployments where safety is paramount. ”', 'Whittelsey added, “ Our technology is not only safer but also more efficient in various temperature conditions. Traditional lithium-ion batteries require significant infrastructure to maintain optimal temperatures, which incurs additional costs. Our batteries can operate effectively across a broader temperature range, reducing the need for such infrastructure. ”', 'Ovadia said that the current BESS grid infrastructure generally consumes energy as a parasitic draw for cooling, something that can be eliminated with the ability to operate at higher temperatures without the dangers of lithium-ion batteries.', 'Furthermore, Whittelsey pointed out the recyclability of the solution over traditional battery products with graphite anodes.', 'ION recently secured a supply agreement and investment from Saint-Gobain in late 2023, one of the world’ s largest ceramics, glass and material suppliers to boost its manufacturing capabilities.', '“ We are working with several other large multinational partners to produce significant quantities at gigawatt-hour scales and achieve global reach in manufacturing, ” Neil said, adding that further “ significant announcements ” from the company are due in the coming quarters.', 'The relatively early-stage company previously raised $ 8 million in 2019, and $ 31 million Series A funding in 2022.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

","['Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity.', 'Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.', 'As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.', 'In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.', 'CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.', 'The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.', 'CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years.', 'As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.', 'Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model.', 'The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.', 'The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.', 'The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid.', 'The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.', 'However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.', '“ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ”', 'Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.', '“ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV.', 'In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

Particularly in large solar markets like California, Texas and Arizona, actual ground-up losses from weather events have been as much as 300% or more than what has been modeled by asset owners.', 'kWh Analytics said that as PV is a relatively new asset class, natural catastrophe models typically used to size insurance premiums often rely on proxy structures to estimate losses. The company said more accurate PV-specific modeling is needed, and differences in technology used ( like trackers with hail-stow protection) should be considered in risk modeling.', 'The insurance provider has developed new models leveraging locational-specific risks, backed by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), significant loss data and satellite imagery to provide a more accurate risk assessment.', 'Reliability testing from Kiwa PVEL found that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect. No module tested by PVEL lost more than 3% production after undergoing a hail stress sequence.', 'The testing lab said that rather than relying on expensive electroluminescent ( EL) testing, it would recommend that asset owners perform annual aerial thermal scans to identify cracked modules that have developed hotspots and are at risk for fires and in need of replacement.
