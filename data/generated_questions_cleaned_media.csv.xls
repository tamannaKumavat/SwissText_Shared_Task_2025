Various international strategies and agreements recognize its potential to serve as a key enabler of the energy transition, reflecting a collective commitment to sustainable, clean energy solutions as a pathway to mitigating climate change and ensuring a resilient energy future ( International Energy Agency, 2020; United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). The advancement of green hydrogen as a sustainable energy source significantly relies on multifaceted partnerships encompassing government, the private sector, and academia. These collaborative efforts are instrumental in overcoming the technological and economic hurdles associated with green hydrogen production and integration. For instance, the Hydrogen Council, a global initiative, exemplifies how over 80 energy, transport, and industrial companies worldwide have united to foster the hydrogen economy through shared investments and technology exchange ( Hydrogen Council, 2020). Government policies and regulatory frameworks also play a vital role in facilitating these partnerships by providing financial incentives and research funding and establishing clear hydrogen production, storage, and distribution standards. The European Union’ s Hydrogen Strategy, launched in 2020, outlines an ambitious roadmap for investments, infrastructure development, and research. It aims to significantly ramp up green hydrogen production by 2030 ( European Commission, 2020). Integrating green hydrogen into the existing energy grid necessitates significant technological innovations and the development of specialized infrastructure. Recent advancements in electrolyzer technology, crucial for green hydrogen production, have improved efficiency and reduced costs. Innovations in renewable energy capture, particularly from solar and wind sources, further bolster the feasibility of green hydrogen as a cost-effective energy solution ( International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022). However, the volatile nature of hydrogen requires the development of specialized storage and transportation infrastructure to handle and distribute it safely. Retrofitting the current energy grids to accommodate hydrogen energy presents a complex challenge, necessitating solutions for compatibility and safety. Strategies include developing hybrid systems that can manage both hydrogen and traditional energy forms, ensuring a smooth transition toward a hydrogen-based energy system ( Energy Transitions Commission, 2021). One notable example of green hydrogen integration is the project in Neom, Saudi Arabia, which, upon completion, will become the world's largest green hydrogen plant. This ambitious project, a partnership between ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM, harnesses solar and wind energy to produce up to 650 tons of green hydrogen daily. The project benefits from substantial financial investment, cutting-edge technology, and strong policy support from the Saudi government, aiming to position the kingdom as a leader in green hydrogen production ( Nereim, 2022). In Europe, the HyGreen Provence Project in France exemplifies regional collaboration for green hydrogen production involving ENGIE, the local government, and various technology providers. Scheduled for completion by 2028, the project aims to generate green hydrogen using solar power, highlighting the role of public-private partnerships in advancing the hydrogen economy. This initiative is expected to significantly contribute to France's energy transition efforts, reducing carbon emissions and creating jobs while providing a scalable model for green hydrogen integration across Europe ( ENGIE, 2021). Integrating green hydrogen into the energy grid faces several significant challenges, spanning technical, economic, and regulatory spheres. Technically, the lower energy efficiency of hydrogen production through electrolysis, compared to the direct use of electricity, poses a challenge, as does the need for safe storage and transportation solutions due to hydrogen's highly flammable nature ( Calabrese et al., 2024). Economically, the high initial costs of electrolyzer installations and the hydrogen storage and distribution infrastructure necessitate substantial and sustained investment. Policy and regulatory hurdles can impede its adoption, including the lack of global hydrogen production and use standards. To address these challenges, ongoing research is dedicated to improving electrolyzer efficiency and developing robust safety protocols. Pilot projects are testing hydrogen's viability in various energy systems. At the same time, international cooperation, as seen in the European Union’ s Hydrogen Strategy, seeks to harmonize regulations and encourage investment in green hydrogen technologies ( European Commission, 2020). Companies and academic institutions worldwide are pioneering green hydrogen technology, driving forward the energy sector's transition to sustainability. Siemens Energy and ITM Power exemplify corporate leadership in this field. They collaborate to enhance electrolyzer technology for more efficient hydrogen production. Their efforts aim to scale up production capacities, reduce costs, and make green hydrogen viable for a broader range of applications ( Siemens Energy, 2020). Within academia, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT) is at the forefront of green hydrogen research, developing novel methods to improve electrolysis efficiency and exploring innovative materials for hydrogen storage ( O'Neill, 2021). Then, there are startups like H2Pro that are pushing the boundaries with unique electrolysis technology, which promises higher efficiency and lower costs. This showcases the vital role of emerging companies in this sector ( H2Pro, 2021). Universities and industries often collaborate, bridging the gap between research and practical application. These partnerships facilitate technology transfer and provide workforce training, ensuring the next generation is equipped with the skills needed for a green hydrogen economy. Such collaborative efforts are crucial for accelerating the adoption of green hydrogen technologies and integrating them into our energy systems. The transformative potential of green hydrogen and renewable energy partnerships is a positive indicator for the global energy grid. Collaborative efforts across sectors are paramount in surmounting green hydrogen's challenges, emphasizing the need for increased investment, research, and supportive policies. As we advance, the collective endeavor to integrate green hydrogen into our energy systems is not just a pathway to sustainability but a cornerstone for securing a resilient and sustainable energy future for generations to come.

10,"As we move toward a sustainable future, green hydrogen is a significant player in the renewable energy landscape. This article discusses how integrating green hydrogen into the grid through strategic partnerships can significantly advance carbon neutrality and energy security. It explores the innovation, infrastructure, and collaborative efforts essential for this transformation, leading toward a cleaner, more resilient energy system. Image Credit: Deemerwha studio/Shutterstock.com Green hydrogen, produced by water electrolysis using renewable energy sources, is at the forefront of the transition to sustainable energy systems. This process ensures that the production of hydrogen, a versatile energy carrier, does not emit carbon dioxide, aligning with global efforts toward carbon neutrality and bolstering energy security. As nations grapple with the urgent need to decarbonize their economies, green hydrogen has garnered significant attention worldwide from government bodies, industries, and environmental organizations. Various international strategies and agreements recognize its potential to serve as a key enabler of the energy transition, reflecting a collective commitment to sustainable, clean energy solutions as a pathway to mitigating climate change and ensuring a resilient energy future ( International Energy Agency, 2020; United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). The advancement of green hydrogen as a sustainable energy source significantly relies on multifaceted partnerships encompassing government, the private sector, and academia. These collaborative efforts are instrumental in overcoming the technological and economic hurdles associated with green hydrogen production and integration. For instance, the Hydrogen Council, a global initiative, exemplifies how over 80 energy, transport, and industrial companies worldwide have united to foster the hydrogen economy through shared investments and technology exchange ( Hydrogen Council, 2020). Government policies and regulatory frameworks also play a vital role in facilitating these partnerships by providing financial incentives and research funding and establishing clear hydrogen production, storage, and distribution standards. The European Union’ s Hydrogen Strategy, launched in 2020, outlines an ambitious roadmap for investments, infrastructure development, and research. It aims to significantly ramp up green hydrogen production by 2030 ( European Commission, 2020). Integrating green hydrogen into the existing energy grid necessitates significant technological innovations and the development of specialized infrastructure. Recent advancements in electrolyzer technology, crucial for green hydrogen production, have improved efficiency and reduced costs. Innovations in renewable energy capture, particularly from solar and wind sources, further bolster the feasibility of green hydrogen as a cost-effective energy solution ( International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022). However, the volatile nature of hydrogen requires the development of specialized storage and transportation infrastructure to handle and distribute it safely. Retrofitting the current energy grids to accommodate hydrogen energy presents a complex challenge, necessitating solutions for compatibility and safety. Strategies include developing hybrid systems that can manage both hydrogen and traditional energy forms, ensuring a smooth transition toward a hydrogen-based energy system ( Energy Transitions Commission, 2021). One notable example of green hydrogen integration is the project in Neom, Saudi Arabia, which, upon completion, will become the world's largest green hydrogen plant. This ambitious project, a partnership between ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM, harnesses solar and wind energy to produce up to 650 tons of green hydrogen daily. The project benefits from substantial financial investment, cutting-edge technology, and strong policy support from the Saudi government, aiming to position the kingdom as a leader in green hydrogen production ( Nereim, 2022). In Europe, the HyGreen Provence Project in France exemplifies regional collaboration for green hydrogen production involving ENGIE, the local government, and various technology providers. Scheduled for completion by 2028, the project aims to generate green hydrogen using solar power, highlighting the role of public-private partnerships in advancing the hydrogen economy. This initiative is expected to significantly contribute to France's energy transition efforts, reducing carbon emissions and creating jobs while providing a scalable model for green hydrogen integration across Europe ( ENGIE, 2021). Integrating green hydrogen into the energy grid faces several significant challenges, spanning technical, economic, and regulatory spheres. Technically, the lower energy efficiency of hydrogen production through electrolysis, compared to the direct use of electricity, poses a challenge, as does the need for safe storage and transportation solutions due to hydrogen's highly flammable nature ( Calabrese et al., 2024). Economically, the high initial costs of electrolyzer installations and the hydrogen storage and distribution infrastructure necessitate substantial and sustained investment. Policy and regulatory hurdles can impede its adoption, including the lack of global hydrogen production and use standards. To address these challenges, ongoing research is dedicated to improving electrolyzer efficiency and developing robust safety protocols. Pilot projects are testing hydrogen's viability in various energy systems. At the same time, international cooperation, as seen in the European Union’ s Hydrogen Strategy, seeks to harmonize regulations and encourage investment in green hydrogen technologies ( European Commission, 2020). Companies and academic institutions worldwide are pioneering green hydrogen technology, driving forward the energy sector's transition to sustainability. Siemens Energy and ITM Power exemplify corporate leadership in this field. They collaborate to enhance electrolyzer technology for more efficient hydrogen production. Their efforts aim to scale up production capacities, reduce costs, and make green hydrogen viable for a broader range of applications ( Siemens Energy, 2020). Within academia, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT) is at the forefront of green hydrogen research, developing novel methods to improve electrolysis efficiency and exploring innovative materials for hydrogen storage ( O'Neill, 2021). Then, there are startups like H2Pro that are pushing the boundaries with unique electrolysis technology, which promises higher efficiency and lower costs. This showcases the vital role of emerging companies in this sector ( H2Pro, 2021). Universities and industries often collaborate, bridging the gap between research and practical application. These partnerships facilitate technology transfer and provide workforce training, ensuring the next generation is equipped with the skills needed for a green hydrogen economy. Such collaborative efforts are crucial for accelerating the adoption of green hydrogen technologies and integrating them into our energy systems. The transformative potential of green hydrogen and renewable energy partnerships is a positive indicator for the global energy grid.

16,"The Japanese technology company Asahi Kasei is further accelerating its hydrogen business activities. On May 13, company representatives and partners including the Japanese government celebrated the official opening of a new hydrogen pilot plant in Kawasaki, Japan. Operation start of this commercial-scale facility was in March 2024. The trial operation of four 0.8 MW modules is another milestone towards the realization of a commercial multi-module 100 MW-class alkaline water electrolysis system for green hydrogen production. The hydrogen market is going to expand rapidly in the coming years. According to the Hydrogen Council, cumulative global installed capacity of water electrolyzers forecasted to reach approximately 300 GW by 2030. To meet this increasing demand, Asahi Kasei is currently developing the Aqualyzer™ alkaline water electrolyzer optimized for the production of green hydrogen. In order to test this new system under realistic conditions in a multi-module setup, the company started constructing a pilot plant at its manufacturing site in Kawasaki in November 2022. The new facility started operation in March 2024, and on May 13, company representatives and partners gathered in Kawasaki to celebrate its official opening. Masami Takenaka, Lead Executive Officer at Asahi Kasei and responsible for the company’ s hydrogen business, said, “ This pilot facility is milestone not only for Asahi Kasei, but also for the global hydrogen business in general. We believe that successfully operating our equipment in this test facility will be a door opener for commercial large-scale multi-module alkaline water electrolyzers and eventually the realization of a hydrogen society ”. For the production of green hydrogen, electrolysis systems need to respond to fluctuating power supply from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar. In the pilot plant, four 0.8 MW Aqualyzer™ modules are being operated under realistic conditions, including operation during maintenance and low power supply during nighttime. In addition, the equipment is designed to simulate fluctuating power input from solar or wind power. By utilizing the data obtained from these trials, Asahi Kasei will further optimize the equipment design, operation methods, and control technology of the electrolysis system. With its multi-module approach, Asahi Kasei aims to combine up to ten modules with a capacity of 10 MW each, enabling commercial large-scale electrolysis systems with a capacity of up to 100 MW. Asahi Kasei’ s hydrogen business is based on more than four decades of large-scale and long-term experience in the field of chlor-alkali electrolysis. Aiming for a total sales volume of ¥100 billion ( €600 million) by 2030, the company plans to start commercial business activities for its alkaline water electrolyzers in 2025. The pilot plant in Kawasaki is an important step toward achieving this goal, after the successful long-term tests of its 10 MW single-stack alkaline-water electrolysis system at the Fukushima Energy Research Field ( FH2R) 1 in Namie, Fukushima, Japan, since 2020. The practical experience gained in Namie and the trial operation at the pilot plant in Kawasaki will further underpin Asahi Kasei’ s market entry with large-scale and highly reliable multi-module alkaline water electrolysis equipment. This experience will also be leveraged for the joint feasibility study with Gentari and JGC for a 60 MW-class electrolyzer in Malaysia targeted for 2027, as announced in November 2023. Construction and operation of the pilot plant is supported by the “ Green Innovation Fund2 ” of Japan’ s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization ( NEDO).

36,"Recent research by Julienne Stroeve and colleagues, published in Communications Earth & Environment, projects that global warming would extend the Hudson Bay’ s ice-free period, shortening the resident polar bears’ hunting season. Image Credit: outdoorsman/Shutterstock.com The authors indicate that if temperatures rise by more than 2.1 degrees Celsius, the ice-free period in most of Hudson Bay may exceed the maximum fasting time that adult polar bears can tolerate. Hudson Bay, located in the Arctic Ocean off the coast of northern Canada, is covered in sea ice during the season and is home to roughly 1,700 polar bears. Polar bears spend the winter on the sea ice, hunting seals, their preferred prey. When the ice melts in the spring, they come ashore and fast during the ice-free summer before returning to the sea ice in the melts. Over the last three decades, the Hudson Bay area has warmed by more than one degree Celsius, extending the ice-free period from around 120 to 150 days. Polar bears in the bay rely on sea ice to hunt. Therefore, an extending ice-free period could affect both their survival rate during the fasting period and their reproductive success during the following hunting season. In the western and southern Hudson Bay regions, where losses in polar bear populations have already been noted, Julienne Stroeve and colleagues estimated projected changes to the ice-free time by analyzing predictions from the IPCC's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 ( CMIP6) models. It is believed that polar bears could comfortably endure 183–218 days of ice-free time. The authors calculated that if global warming surpasses 2.1 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius, respectively, the ice-free period might last longer than the 183-day limit in the western and southern Hudson Bay regions. Furthermore, they predict that seasonal ice melt will probably happen sooner in the spring. Since cubs are usually born between November and January, this might decrease the bears ' nursing time, which could lower their reproductive success. The scientists emphasize that if global warming is kept to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, the Hudson Bay polar bear population has a strong chance of survival. Stroeve, J., et al.

48,"Recent research by Julienne Stroeve and colleagues, published in Communications Earth & Environment, projects that global warming would extend the Hudson Bay’ s ice-free period, shortening the resident polar bears’ hunting season. Image Credit: outdoorsman/Shutterstock.com The authors indicate that if temperatures rise by more than 2.1 degrees Celsius, the ice-free period in most of Hudson Bay may exceed the maximum fasting time that adult polar bears can tolerate. Hudson Bay, located in the Arctic Ocean off the coast of northern Canada, is covered in sea ice during the season and is home to roughly 1,700 polar bears. Polar bears spend the winter on the sea ice, hunting seals, their preferred prey. When the ice melts in the spring, they come ashore and fast during the ice-free summer before returning to the sea ice in the melts. Over the last three decades, the Hudson Bay area has warmed by more than one degree Celsius, extending the ice-free period from around 120 to 150 days. Polar bears in the bay rely on sea ice to hunt. Therefore, an extending ice-free period could affect both their survival rate during the fasting period and their reproductive success during the following hunting season. In the western and southern Hudson Bay regions, where losses in polar bear populations have already been noted, Julienne Stroeve and colleagues estimated projected changes to the ice-free time by analyzing predictions from the IPCC's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 ( CMIP6) models. It is believed that polar bears could comfortably endure 183–218 days of ice-free time. The authors calculated that if global warming surpasses 2.1 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius, respectively, the ice-free period might last longer than the 183-day limit in the western and southern Hudson Bay regions. Furthermore, they predict that seasonal ice melt will probably happen sooner in the spring. Since cubs are usually born between November and January, this might decrease the bears ' nursing time, which could lower their reproductive success.

67,"Researchers at the Physics Department of Oxford University have developed a ground-breaking method to generate more solar power without relying on silicon-based solar panels. Their innovation involves using a novel material that can generate electricity on the surfaces of everyday items such as cell phones, cars, and backpacks. This novel light-absorbing material is thin and flexible enough to be applied to the surface of almost any building or everyday object. Using an innovative technique developed at Oxford, which layers multiple light-absorbing materials within a single solar cell, the researchers have captured a broader range of the light spectrum, enabling greater power generation from the same amount of sunlight. This ultra-thin material, utilizing the multi-junction method, has now received independent certification for achieving over 27% energy efficiency. This efficiency matches that of conventional silicon photovoltaics, which typically use single-layer, energy-generating materials. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ( AIST) granted the certification ahead of the scientific study's publication later this year. During just five years experimenting with our stacking or multi-junction approach, we have raised power conversion efficiency from around 6% to over 27%, close to the limits of what single-layer photovoltaics can achieve today. We believe that, over time, this approach could enable the photovoltaic devices to achieve far greater efficiencies, exceeding 45%. Dr. Shuaifeng Hu, Post Doctoral Fellow, Physics Department, University of Oxford With an energy efficiency of over 27%, this new material compares favorably with the approximately 22% efficiency of current solar panels, which convert about 22% of sunlight into energy. The versatility of this ultra-thin and flexible material is also crucial. It is nearly 150 times thinner than a silicon wafer at just over one micron thick. Unlike traditional photovoltaics, which are typically applied to silicon panels, this new material can be applied to almost any surface. By using new materials which can be applied as a coating, we have shown we can replicate and out-perform silicon whilst also gaining flexibility. This is important because it promises more solar power without the need for so many silicon-based panels or specially-built solar farms. Dr. Junke Wang, Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions Postdoc Fellow, Physics Department, University of Oxford The researchers believe that this method could make solar energy the most sustainable renewable energy source while continuing to drive down costs. Since 2010, the global average price of solar electricity has decreased by about 90%, making it nearly a third less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels. As new materials like thin-film perovskite reduce the reliance on silicon panels and specialized solar farms, these innovations promise even greater cost savings in the future. “ We can envisage perovskite coatings being applied to broader types of surface to generate cheap solar power, such as the roof of cars and buildings and even the backs of mobile phones. If more solar energy can be generated in this way, we can foresee less need in the longer term to use silicon panels or build more and more solar farms, ” Dr. Wang added. Around 30 experts, including the researchers, are working on photovoltaics under the direction of Oxford University Physics Department Professor of Renewable Energy Henry Snaith. Their groundbreaking work in photovoltaics, which has benefited from a customized robotic laboratory, began about ten years ago.

Their work has already begun to find applications in the construction, utilities, and auto manufacturing sectors, demonstrating its strong commercial potential. Oxford PV, a UK company founded in 2010 by Professor Henry Snaith, the Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, to commercialize perovskite photovoltaics, has recently begun large-scale manufacturing of these solar cells at its factory in Brandenburg-an-der-Havel, near Berlin, Germany.

The latest innovations in solar materials and techniques demonstrated in our labs could become a platform for a new industry, manufacturing materials to generate solar energy more sustainably and cheaply by using existing buildings, vehicles, and objects. “ Supplying these materials will be a fast-growth new industry in the global green economy, and we have shown that the UK is innovating and leading the way scientifically. However, without new incentives and a better pathway to convert this innovation into manufacturing, the UK will miss the opportunity to lead this new global industry, ” Professor Snaith added.

88,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL) of the US Department of Energy conducted an analysis of a behavioral study and found that owners of electric cars ( EVs) are more likely to take it a step further and install solar panels in their homes. On the other hand, albeit not as much, having solar panels has an impact on a homeowner's decision to purchase an electric car. Researchers at NREL determined that people who own electric vehicles tend to also adopt solar technology in their homes. Image Credit: iStock A survey of 869 San Francisco Bay Area households served as the study's primary source of data. Owners of electric vehicles ( EVs) may be more likely to invest in photovoltaics ( PVs) because the installation of solar panels may offset the residential portion of the energy bill required to charge them at home, according to NREL's Shivam Sharda, lead author of the research paper that analyzes the survey results. Both EVs and PVs have a complementary nature, which might play a pivotal role in energy systems resiliency, addressing concerns regarding grid stability and power management strategies. The study was published in the journal Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. An interdisciplinary team of researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the University of California Santa Barbara, and NREL's Venu M. Garikapati, Janet L. Reyna, and Bingrong Sun co-authored the work. As a component of the WholeTraveler Transportation Behavior Study, the survey was carried out in 2018. The study was done in a year where a lot might have happened, the researchers acknowledged. With the release of the 2022 Residential Energy Consumption study, they went over the subject again and noted that the association between EV and PV might still hold true. Rooftop solar panels were owned or previously owned by more respondents in the 2018 study ( 9.1% vs. 6.5%) than electric vehicles. The researchers observed that solar panel technology is less expensive than most EVs and that PV technology has been available for a longer period of time than EVs. A relationship between the two technologies was discovered. Just 8% of non-EV owners had photovoltaic systems, compared to 25% of EV owners who did. The behavioral survey identified two factors: being aware of them and being approachable enough to inquire about them, which may have led an individual to embrace one or both of the technologies. If you have a friend or a family member who owns a rooftop solar panel or an EV, you become more educated about the technology, so you know the pros and cons by talking to them. That has a significant influence on your owning EVs or PVs. Although governments provide incentives for the adoption of PVs and EVs, the researchers recommended taking into account policies that work together to speed up the adoption of both technologies. Such incentives may encourage EV owners to adopt solar technology far earlier than is now the case because they are motivated to use PV anyway. A household's speed of adoption of cross-sectoral sustainable technology will determine how quickly decarbonization targets are met. The study, according to the researchers, shed light on the relationship between EVs and PV, but further comprehensive studies are required to analyze the relationship between residential energy consumption and transportation as it is changing and to find strategies to decarbonize energy use in all sectors. The research was funded by the Vehicle Technologies Office of the Department of Energy. Sharda, S., et.al., ( 2024).

The study found that EV owners are more likely to invest in PVs, and both technologies have complementary nature, addressing concerns regarding grid stability and power management strategies. However, the study highlights the need for further research on the relationship between residential energy consumption and transportation. The context also mentions the study's findings, the data sources, and the researchers' recommendations for policies to speed up the adoption of both technologies. The mentioning of the Year 2022, where a lot might have happened, is a red herring and doesn't provide much relevant information.

More info. Lithium-ion batteries are used in nearly every electric vehicle and have a service life of around 10 years before replacement is needed. Electric car batteries are highly recyclable, with around 90 percent of the cell being recoverable as a commercial activity. This is achievable if the recycling companies profit from the recycling process. Wiring and plastics can be stripped and recycled. The precious mined metals contained in the battery cell electrolyte can be dangerous to access since they are flammable, explosive and very toxic. These hazards must be dealt with before cell components can be recycled. Some car manufacturers, such as Volvo, have committed to developing second-life applications for high-voltage batteries as part of creating a closed-loop system that ensures all materials in cars are recycled. Working with BatteryLoop, Volvo is developing batteries used for electric cars that can be used for a solar energy storage system, which powers charging points for cars and bikes. Volvo is also piloting how to use plug-in hybrids as an energy storage unit for a hydropower operation in Sweden. The aim is to discover how long batteries last in those situations and work out the sustainability and financial benefits. Volvo reveals each battery produces around six to eight tons of CO2, which requires a lot of raw metals, but it is trying to establish if extending battery life is worthwhile, or whether it is better to recycle immediately. Nissan uses second-life batteries from its Leaf car model for energy storage, with an off-the-shelf home or commercial unit called xStorage as a rival to Tesla’ s Powerwall. Honda is planning a collaboration with Societe Nouvelle d’ Affinage des Metaux ( SNAM) to collect and recycle batteries for second-life use or the extraction of precious elements. BMW announced a partnership with Off Grid Energy for a sustainable second-life solution for end-of-life BMW and MINI electric and hybrid models. Battery modules will create mobile power units, for which prototypes powered by lithium-ion units taken from MINI are already being used. It has a 40 kWh capacity, with a 7.2 kW fast charge. BMW and Off Grid say as more modules become available as electric cars age, the system will have a capacity of up to 180 kWh, with multiple charges of up to 50 kW. This will double the CO2 reduction achieved over the original battery use in the car. Renault launched its SmartHub project in 2020, an energy system comprising 1,000 second-life electric-car batteries, to provide energy for social housing, transport, residential homes and local businesses. Renault claims its system can store enough energy to power 1,700 homes for a day. Jaguar Land Rover has developed a portable electric-car charger, using battery packs from I-Pace prototypes, called the Off-Grid Battery Energy Storage System ( ESS), which has a capacity of 125 kWh, with integrated solar panels. It is designed for commercial hire when access to mains electricity is unavailable. Lithium-ion batteries used for electric vehicles require large quantities of cobalt, much of which is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has raised issues concerning child mining and human rights abuses, as well as ecological concerns over pollution and other mining hazards. Faraday Institution research fellow, Dr. Gavin Harper, claims: `` It may make more economic sense to recycle EV batteries for use in brand-new batteries for cars, rather than using them in a used state in a less demanding application such as power storage. '' Mercedes agrees with this principle after shelving its own home energy storage system after just one year, whilst Nissan remains committed to transferring electric-car battery technology for home-energy use. Recycled metals are very valuable and require a combination of pyro and hydro-metallurgy processes to recover materials. Umicore’ s recycling plant in Belgium recycles approximately 35,000 EV batteries per year, with plans to scale up production, as more batteries require recycling over time. Fortum, a Finnish company, announced a development in recycling lithium from rechargeable batteries, using a low-CO2 hydrometallurgical recycling process to recover nickel, cobalt and manganese, boasting a recycling achievement of over 80 percent. In January 2022, Veolia opened its first battery recycling plant in the UK in the West Midlands. It aims to process 20 percent of the UK’ s end-of-life electric car batteries by 2024, describing its process as ‘ urban mining’, with reduced water consumption and 50 percent less greenhouse gas emissions, compared to mining new raw materials. Tesla is also planning to recycle its batteries so that metal mining will not be needed. Sodium-ion batteries operate in the same way as lithium-ion batteries and can be recycled in the same way. The advantage of sodium-ion batteries is that sodium is less costly and more plentiful, but they still need to be manufactured to achieve the same performance rate as lithium-ion batteries because the technology is not quite there yet. Solid-state batteries are something many big car manufacturers are investigating because they are less flammable, and potentially more efficient than lithium-ion ones, although they do present different recycling challenges. Solid-state batteries can store more energy than lithium-ion ones and are both safer and faster to charge. In a lithium-ion battery, the electrolytes take the form of a gooey liquid, whereas, in solid-state batteries, the electrolytes are made up of solid thin layers, making them far more stable and less flammable. Electric cars do not use solid-state batteries due to them being more difficult to scale up production to the necessary volume needed for widespread use. Solid-state electrolytes need to be good conductors, but being thin and weak makes them prone to cracking and around eight times more expensive to manufacture. Nissan has launched ‘ Ambition 2030’, its electrification commitment to launch a solid-state battery car by 2028, from its pilot plant in Yokohama, Japan. Nissan is also aiming to bring the cost of solid-state batteries down to eliminate the price gap between electric and combustion-engined cars. OneD Battery Sciences, a US-based company, has developed a nano silicon technology called SINANODE, aimed at simplifying the process of using nano silicon technology, and making it more cost-effective. The SINANODE process supercharges commercial graphite by fusing large quantities of tiny silicon nanowires, producing thousands of silicon nanowires on each graphite particle. The silicon can triple the amount of energy stored, decrease charging time by half, and reduce costs. It also reduces battery weight and lowers CO2 produced per kWh, making it more cost-effective by reducing the costs of materials and cells used in electric vehicles. Whichever electric battery becomes the market leader over time, one thing that is commonly agreed upon by car manufacturers is that it makes both economic and ecological sense to leave as many metals in the ground as possible by re-using whatever metals have already been mined in the most efficient and sustainable ways possible.

158,"The Solar Energy Industries Association ( SEIA) is launching a 501 ( c) 3 nonprofit to accelerate the transition to carbon-free electricity through clean energy research and analysis. The Solar and Storage Industries Institute ( SI2) will serve as SEIA’ s charitable and educational arm, using research, public education initiatives, and policymaker engagement to remove barriers to clean energy deployment. SI2 will propose and incubate new solutions that encourage the growth of the solar and storage industry. The organization will also tackle some of the biggest challenges facing the solar and storage industry, like land use concerns, antiquated rate designs, workforce development and environmental justice, and interconnection roadblocks, all in an effort to combat climate change and create a more equitable clean energy economy. “ We largely have the technologies we need to address the climate crisis, but several barriers remain to widespread adoption of solar and storage, ” says Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’ s president and CEO and the new chair of SI2’ s board of directors. “ The window for climate action is narrowing quickly, and we must double down on the clean energy research and analysis needed to dismantle systemic challenges that are holding back the solar and storage industry. ” David Gahl, SEIA’ s current senior director of state policy, East, will lead SI2’ s work and serve as the institute’ s first executive director. “ I’ m thrilled to take on this challenge and work with a diverse range of stakeholders to solve the most pressing issues facing America’ s clean energy sector, ” states Gahl. “ SI2 offers the solar and storage industry a special opportunity to harness its creativity and use innovative thinking to chart a new path to a carbon-free future and an equitable clean energy economy. ” While the organization will focus on a variety of issues, one emerging challenge in the solar industry is land use. Siting clean energy projects requires community engagement and long-term planning that minimizes impact to the environment and surrounding community. These projects must also account for access to transmission lines, upgrades to grid infrastructure, and several other factors that can affect the outcome of a large-scale solar project. SI2’ s first research project will create best practices for solar companies looking to create large-scale solar projects and other resources that will help the industry navigate these challenges. In addition to Gahl’ s role as executive director and Hopper’ s role as board chair, SOLV Energy CEO George Hershman is serving as SI2’ s board secretary, and Nautilus Solar co-CEO Laura Stern is board treasurer. “ We applaud SEIA’ s efforts to launch SI2 in an effort to tackle barriers to clean energy deployment head-on, ” comments Stern. “ It’ s exciting to be at the forefront of an initiative that will make significant progress to combat climate change and create a clean, sustainable future by offering an equitable and affordable renewable energy choice. ” “ Over the last decade the solar industry has been a beacon of innovation, persevering through numerous challenges to emerge as a leading provider of cost-effective energy in the United States, ” mentions Hershman. “ A brighter future powered by clean energy is possible, and the formation of SI2 will help establish a direct road map to more efficient solar and storage deployment for generations to come. ” Solar energy accounts for roughly 4% of U.S. electricity generation today. If solar energy reaches 30% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, electricity sector emissions would be cut in half. If the industry reaches its Solar+ Decade goals, the solar and storage industry would create more than $ 800 billion in economic activity and add more than one million well-paying jobs. Solar and storage businesses stand ready to achieve this goal, but significant red tape and supply chain hurdles stand in the way. SI2 will work closely with SEIA and lean on its staff and resources while the organization establishes itself. As the organization grows and secures additional funding sources, SI2 will build its team and announce additional priorities and initiatives. I applaud your support for the S12 commitment to resolve some of the issues that are major road blocks in advancing the future of solar projects. As a property owner I have been made aware of some of the issues that solar projects encounter, interconnection with distribution lines, permits, setbacks, community resentment. I believe that when we invest in and build upon technology that is good for the future of everyone and provides a positive impact for the existing energy monopolies, the communities they serve, local government and the property owners who commit to long term contracts.

230,"Hanwha Solutions, a Korean company that owns clean energy solutions provider Qcells, has received a $ 320 million investment plan for solar manufacturing expansion in the United States and Korea with the aim of providing secure, cleaner energy amid mounting calls for energy security and net-zero emissions. Hanwha said it will seek to spend $ 170 million building a 1.4 GW solar module production facility in the U.S. Qcells already operates a 1.7 GW module factory in Dalton, Ga. With the new factory expected to come online as early as the first half of 2023, Qcells’ total production capacity in the U.S. will exceed 3 GW – equivalent to one-third of current U.S. solar module production capacity. The company also announced its plan to expand cell production capacity in Korea. By investing $ 150 million, the company will expand its cell factory in there. When the factory expansions are complete next year, overall cell capacity in Korea will be 5.4 GW. It is the first investment in Korean solar cell manufacturing in five years. The investments aim to address growing demand for renewable energy, as ongoing energy market turbulence has sent fossil fuel prices soaring. Already worsened by a global supply squeeze during the pandemic, these price fluctuations have prompted calls around the world to reduce fossil fuel dependence aiming for energy security and carbon reduction. “ Growing uncertainties tell us that securing reliable, sustainable energy has become more important than ever before, ” states Justin Lee, CEO of Hanwha Qcells. “ To do this, Qcells will increase renewable supply from diversified sources and find cleaner ways to produce energy. That way, we will contribute to both energy security and net-zero emissions. ” To improve and further decarbonize its solar panel production process, Hanwha Solutions will secure low-carbon polysilicon from manufacturers around the world. In April, the company agreed with Korean polysilicon manufacturer OCI to receive polysilicon made in factories using carbon-free hydroelectricity. OCI will provide Hanwha with “ clean polysilicon ” for the next 10 years. Other sources are providing low-carbon polysilicon to Hanwha as well. In March, the company became the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, the Norway-headquartered polysilicon manufacturer, which operates massive production facilities in the US. REC Silicon similarly uses hydropower to make solar-grade polysilicon at its production facility in Moses Lake, Wash. Faced with soaring energy prices in Europe, the company also came up with solutions to lower heating bills. Qcells is working with Samsung Electronics to introduce a smart heating system with the aim of hitting the market in June. Combing Qcells’ solar panels and energy storage system with Samsung’ s Eco Heating System, it will lower heating bills for households in Europe. Hanwha Solutions’ decision to expand the Qcells’ module factory in the U.S. comes as a part of its effort to help rebuild the domestic US solar supply chain. It will create good-paying job opportunities for generations to come. Already employing approximately 750 staff at its module production facility in the U. S., Hanwha aims to further boost the number of local jobs with the opening of the new module production facility. Upon the implementation of long-term, durable policy designed to incentivize solar manufacturing, Hanwha will further expand investments in the U.S., including wafers and cells. This requires implementing a “ whole-of-government ” approach, including smart trade policy, strengthened Buy American rules, and especially long-term domestic manufacturing tax legislation. “ Ensuring policy certainty is crucial to realizing our goal of rebuilding the US solar value chain, ” adds Lee. “ With our relentless efforts to provide reliable, sustainable energy, we will do our utmost to solidify Qcells as the dependable choice for the U.S. solar market. ” Solar Industry offers industry participants probing, comprehensive assessments of the technology, tools and trends that are driving this dynamic energy sector.

236,"The report from kWh Analytics, with input from several industry leaders, identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather, such as hail, and operational risks. A report from kWh Analytics, a climate insurance provider, released its 6th annual Solar Risk Assessment report, providing a data-driven overview of risks to solar assets. The report included contributions from solar industry leaders in technology, financing, and insurance. “ To meet renewable energy deployment goals, the focus needs to be on smart growth – relying on data to inform decisions and utilizing resilience measures to protect assets, ” said kWh Analytics chief executive officer Jason Kaminsky. The report identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather and operational risks. For the first time this year, battery energy storage-related risks were included. This news covers the extreme weather risks, with subsequent articles reviewing operational and storage-related risks. Data from kWh Analytics found that risk modeling for damage from weather events has been heavily overlooked. Particularly in large solar markets like California, Texas and Arizona, actual ground-up losses from weather events have been as much as 300% or more than what has been modeled by asset owners. kWh Analytics said that as PV is a relatively new asset class, natural catastrophe models typically used to size insurance premiums often rely on proxy structures to estimate losses. The company said more accurate PV-specific modeling is needed, and differences in technology used ( like trackers with hail-stow protection) should be considered in risk modeling. The insurance provider has developed new models leveraging locational-specific risks, backed by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), significant loss data and satellite imagery to provide a more accurate risk assessment. Reliability testing from Kiwa PVEL found that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect. No module tested by PVEL lost more than 3% production after undergoing a hail stress sequence. The testing lab said that rather than relying on expensive electroluminescent ( EL) testing, it would recommend that asset owners perform annual aerial thermal scans to identify cracked modules that have developed hotspots and are at risk for fires and in need of replacement. Fire risks are most severe in the rare case that a module with a failed bypass diode has cracked cells. Modules protected by hail stow post only 0.8% power loss Waaree found that lab-tested solar modules that tilt to a stowed position to protect from direct hail impacts only lose 0.8% of their production from being in a sub-optimal angle during hail events. In turn, the modules were able to avoid damage altogether by stowing. The losses perform far better than the IEC standard of 5% losses from stowing. Data from Alliant Power found that assets in high-risk areas can reduce insurance costs by up to 50% by investing in resilience measures like selecting heat-tempered panels and trackers that enable hail stowing. “ It pays to take time to differentiate your project and select highly qualified partners when it comes to risk and insurance, ” said Alliant Insurance Services. Natural catastrophe events are on the rise, with billion-dollar weather events increasing from an average of 13 per year in the 2010s to an average of 22 per year in the 2020s, with 28 billion-dollar damage weather events occurring in 2023 alone, said Alliant. Solar developer Longroad Energy shared a case study under which different tilt angles and their impact on module protection from hail impacts were assessed. The report was based on data from RETC and tracker provider Nextracker. It found that a 50-degree stow led to a 33% estimated module breakage probability, while 60-degree stow had an 8% probability, and 75-degree stow led to only a 1% risk of breakage from hail. The next report in this series will review the kWh Analytics assessment of solar asset operational risks.

It found that a 50-degree stow led to a 33% estimated module breakage probability, while 60-degree stow had an 8% probability, and 75-degree stow led to only a 1% risk of breakage from hail. The next report in this series will review the kWh Analytics assessment of solar asset operational risks.

The context also mentions that reliability testing has shown that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect.",3.0,"This question can guide researchers and developers in selecting the most suitable solar modules that can withstand hail storms, thereby improving the overall efficiency and durability of solar panel installations. The information can also be used to inform drilling and manufacturing processes, enabling the creation of modules that are more resistant to hail damage.",3.0,"The question refers to a general topic related to solar modules and hail events, but it lacks specific details, such as the type of solar modules being discussed, the environment, or the location. It appears to require general knowledge about solar modules and hail events, but it's not possible to provide a definitive answer without making assumptions."
246,"The report from kWh Analytics, with input from several industry leaders, identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather, such as hail, and operational risks. A report from kWh Analytics, a climate insurance provider, released its 6th annual Solar Risk Assessment report, providing a data-driven overview of risks to solar assets. The report included contributions from solar industry leaders in technology, financing, and insurance. “ To meet renewable energy deployment goals, the focus needs to be on smart growth – relying on data to inform decisions and utilizing resilience measures to protect assets, ” said kWh Analytics chief executive officer Jason Kaminsky. The report identified 14 risks to be aware of in the solar industry, including risks related to extreme weather and operational risks. For the first time this year, battery energy storage-related risks were included. This news covers the extreme weather risks, with subsequent articles reviewing operational and storage-related risks. Data from kWh Analytics found that risk modeling for damage from weather events has been heavily overlooked. Particularly in large solar markets like California, Texas and Arizona, actual ground-up losses from weather events have been as much as 300% or more than what has been modeled by asset owners. kWh Analytics said that as PV is a relatively new asset class, natural catastrophe models typically used to size insurance premiums often rely on proxy structures to estimate losses. The company said more accurate PV-specific modeling is needed, and differences in technology used ( like trackers with hail-stow protection) should be considered in risk modeling. The insurance provider has developed new models leveraging locational-specific risks, backed by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL), significant loss data and satellite imagery to provide a more accurate risk assessment. Reliability testing from Kiwa PVEL found that broken cells from impacts like hail are less catastrophic to solar module performance than one may expect. No module tested by PVEL lost more than 3% production after undergoing a hail stress sequence. The testing lab said that rather than relying on expensive electroluminescent ( EL) testing, it would recommend that asset owners perform annual aerial thermal scans to identify cracked modules that have developed hotspots and are at risk for fires and in need of replacement. Fire risks are most severe in the rare case that a module with a failed bypass diode has cracked cells. Modules protected by hail stow post only 0.8% power loss Waaree found that lab-tested solar modules that tilt to a stowed position to protect from direct hail impacts only lose 0.8% of their production from being in a sub-optimal angle during hail events. In turn, the modules were able to avoid damage altogether by stowing. The losses perform far better than the IEC standard of 5% losses from stowing. Data from Alliant Power found that assets in high-risk areas can reduce insurance costs by up to 50% by investing in resilience measures like selecting heat-tempered panels and trackers that enable hail stowing. “ It pays to take time to differentiate your project and select highly qualified partners when it comes to risk and insurance, ” said Alliant Insurance Services. Natural catastrophe events are on the rise, with billion-dollar weather events increasing from an average of 13 per year in the 2010s to an average of 22 per year in the 2020s, with 28 billion-dollar damage weather events occurring in 2023 alone, said Alliant.

291,"Greece’ s energy storage market is hot with a number of new policies paving the way to new applications in the market. The government is now working a new plan, which will allow the colocation of batteries with existing solar plants as well as standalone, in front of the meter battery energy storage systems. Last year, Greece generated 57% of its electricity demand via renewable energies. This year the country is expected to score an even higher percentage of renewable electricity, although this success is accompanied by the thorny issue of curtailing surplus green electricity at times when the electricity system can not accommodate it. Therefore, rather belatedly, Greece has turned its attention to energy storage. So far, the country is running a 1 GW program targeting standalone, front-of-the-meter batteries. Greece has already run two tenders awarding about 700 MW of battery storage projects. A call for the program’ s third tender, targeting specifically battery systems in former coal mining regions, is imminent. Awarded projects, under the 1 GW program, receive public subsidy support in the form of capital expenditure and operational expenditure subsidies. Greece’ s minister of the environment and energy Theodoros Skylakakis told a local energy conference in Athens earlier in July that the country is blessed with exceptional renewable energy resources and in order to reap the benefits of it, it should speed up energy storage development. In line with this, Skylakakis said that the ministry is working towards a plan that opens the battery storage market in two ways. Firstly, allowing the colocation of behind-the-meter batteries along existing photovoltaic plants. And secondly, allowing new standalone, in front of the meter batteries without public subsidy support. Both policies might prove important milestones in the country’ s energy transition plan. However, there are plenty of crucial details that need to be specified for the new policies to prove meaningful. To continue reading, please visit our new ESS News website.

301,"Analysis from research firm Wood Mackenzie shows solar remained the most awarded form of renewable energy in government tenders last year, but its share of total volume dropped from 59% to 44%. In 2024, government tenders are predicted to at least match 2023 levels. Research firm Wood Mackeznie says renewable capacity reached 137 GW through government tenders in 2023. A 10% increase year on year, Wood Mackenzie says the growth came “ despite sector cost headwinds, logistics tensions, and the energy crisis ” in 2023. PV capacity was the most awarded form of renewable energy through government tenders last year. The Asia-Pacific region received two-thirds of government contracts worldwide, at approximately 90 GW. This was buoyed by China, where more than 55 GW were allocated through 49 renewable energy tenders. India awarded 20 GW over 55 tenders, while Germany was the largest player in Europe, with 19 GW awarded through 11 rounds. Wood Mackenzie is now predicting government tenders will drive at least 102 GW of global renewable capacity in 2024, including at least 60 GW of offshore wind. It anticipates that the overall volume will grow as the year progresses, eventually matching 2023 levels. “ Tenders have increased each year, and Wood Mackenzie expects to see some big rewards in 2024 – the EMEA region will hold more than 50% of expected tenders, mostly for offshore wind capacity, ” said Ana Fernandez Garcia, a senior research analyst at the firm. “ Individual major markets, such as China, will continue to dominate. ” WoodMac’ s analysis says renewable energy tenders are currently experiencing two opposing trends. It explains that while the offshore wind energy sector has witnessed “ intense competition, ” resulting in subsidy-free tenders and negative bids, onshore and solar energy tenders have gone undersubscribed. The research firm says the lack of interested bidders left 30% of the tendered volume unallocated in 2023. It adds that zero bidding has led to canceling contracts later in the developing phase of projects. Fernandez Garcia says both situations put renewables deployment at risk and illustrate the need for tender design reform. She adds that Wood Mackenzie expects an increase in ceiling prices and non-price criteria to play a prominent role in the year ahead. Wood Mackenzie’ s latest analysis follows recent research on the levelized cost of electricity ( LCOE) in the Asia-Pacific region, and predictions for annual PV growth through 2032, both published earlier this year.

328,"The US solid-state battery developer announced it has achieved 800 cycles with its battery, marking significant progress towards commercialization. If this trend continues, the development holds promising potential for grid-scale projects. ION Storage Systems has reached the 800-cycle mark with its solid-state battery, which it plans to bring into commercial production. The battery previously exceeded 125 cycles with less than five percent capacity loss in March, 2024. The milestone of 800 cycles was achieved without encountering the common issues that can complicate the market readiness of solid-state batteries. The battery, which uses a ceramic electrolyte separator was tested without compression and showed no signs of swelling or volume change. It means the battery will not require compression, swell budget, an extensive cooling system, or heavy fire barriers when rolled out, according to ION. Neil Ovadia, VP of Supply Chain at ION, spoke with ESS News about the company’ s progress following previous coverage in 2022. “ The last two years have been transformational. We’ ve grown from about 20 employees to over 75, expanded into two larger buildings, and broken ground on our pilot manufacturing facility, ” said Ovadia. “ We’ re focused on the defense and consumer products markets initially, with plans to transition into electric vehicles and grid storage as we reduce costs and increase energy density, ” he added. The technical achievement of the battery itself was the real highlight, according to Ovadia. “ We’ ve made big strides in our product’ s cycle life. We went from proving 125 cycles in March to achieving 800 cycles by July. Importantly, these cycles were achieved at room temperature with no compression or additional aids, demonstrating the true potential of our solid-state technology, ” he said. Robert Whittelsey, Principal Technical Program Manager at ION, told ESS News the technical process behind the testing, and highlighted the significance. “ 800 cycles is significant because that’ s beyond most consumer electronics. That starts to get into EV and grid storage applications, and even space-based applications that require a high cycle life. So this is something that could be used for all applications. ” Ovadia added, “ It’ s a confluence of all the characteristics of that battery that got to 800 cycles. One thing that you find in solid-state batteries is this requirement for compression, this requirement for heat, this coddling of the battery to achieve those cycles. It’ s meaningful when you look at it as a final product, it makes it more expensive, heavier, and takes away from the potential and promise of a solid-sate battery. ION’ s advancements with its solid-state batteries are highly relevant for grid-scale applications, with the company recently awarded $ 20 million from the US government’ s ARPA-E Scale-Up program, which aims to accelerate the development of larger format cells for grid storage. Ovadia said, “ We are focused on scaling up our technology to produce larger, more cost-effective batteries. This involves collaborating with manufacturing partners and leveraging our university research partnerships to enhance both the mechanical and electrochemical aspects of our technology. ” He further emphasized the robustness and safety of their technology, stating, “ Our batteries are inherently safer, eliminating the risk of fires associated with lithium-ion batteries. This makes them ideal for large-scale energy storage deployments where safety is paramount. ” Whittelsey added, “ Our technology is not only safer but also more efficient in various temperature conditions. Traditional lithium-ion batteries require significant infrastructure to maintain optimal temperatures, which incurs additional costs. Our batteries can operate effectively across a broader temperature range, reducing the need for such infrastructure. ” Ovadia said that the current BESS grid infrastructure generally consumes energy as a parasitic draw for cooling, something that can be eliminated with the ability to operate at higher temperatures without the dangers of lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, Whittelsey pointed out the recyclability of the solution over traditional battery products with graphite anodes. ION recently secured a supply agreement and investment from Saint-Gobain in late 2023, one of the world’ s largest ceramics, glass and material suppliers to boost its manufacturing capabilities. “ We are working with several other large multinational partners to produce significant quantities at gigawatt-hour scales and achieve global reach in manufacturing, ” Neil said, adding that further “ significant announcements ” from the company are due in the coming quarters. The relatively early-stage company previously raised $ 8 million in 2019, and $ 31 million Series A funding in 2022. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

346,"Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity. Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total. As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand. In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions. CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions. The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025. CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years. As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data. Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model. The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day. The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges. The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid. The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace. However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies. “ The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets, ” said the EIA. “ Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’ s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’ s neck. ” Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive. “ PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘ package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants, ” said DNV. In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.

In California, curtailment is increasing due to the outagepacing of solar generation additions, leading to a rise in congestion-related gluts of generation.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/01/california-curtailing-more-solar-than-ever-before/#respond,Sustainability & Technological Innovation Questions,4.0,"The passage provides a clear explanation of curtailment of solar energy generation, its causes, and its consequences. It also discusses potential solutions to alleviate curtailment, such as the Western Energy Imbalance Market and energy storage. The passage is well-structured and provides sufficient context for understanding the issue. However, it may not provide a comprehensive answer to the question, as it does not discuss the global context or potential long-term effects of curtailment.",4.0,"Curtailment of solar energy generation is a critical issue that affects the overall performance of solar power plants. It refers to the reduction in solar energy generation due to non-technical factors such as weather conditions, resource availability, and maintenance. In the context of California, curtailment is increasing due to the state's aggressive renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policies, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the adoption of renewable energy sources. The increasing curtailment of solar energy generation in California is primarily caused by the growing demand for solar power and the limited availability of available solar resources, particularly during periods of high demand or low resource availability. Understanding curtailment is essential for solar developers, policymakers, and grid operators to optimize solar power integration and ensure a stable energy supply.",3.0,"The question provides general knowledge about solar energy generation and implies a connection to a specific geographic region, California, but the context of the question is not specified."
349,"Curtailment of power output increases when solar generation surpasses transmission capacity. Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is currently on the rise in California, according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA). In 2022, the California Independent System Operator ( CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total. As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs when there is congestion, when power lines don’ t have enough capacity to deliver power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand. In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said the EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions. CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions. The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market ( WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025. CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-23 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next 10 years. As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data. Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “ duck curve ” model. The phenomenon of the “ duck curve ” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation ( mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand ( late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day. The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges. The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “ duck curve ” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for CAISO to balance the grid. The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand.

This mismatch between supply and demand can lead to rolling blackouts, making the duck curve problem a critical issue in California's efforts to manage its electricity market. Furthermore, the duck curve problem is also relevant to machine learning developers building NLP applications, as it requires understanding the complex interactions between different energy sources and demand patterns, which can be modeled using natural language processing techniques.",4.0,"The question refers to a specific context, ""California's electricity market"", which suggests that it is not entirely self-explanatory without additional information.

376,"In the Spring Budget, the Chancellor confirmed nuclear as “ environmentally sustainable ” removing an element of uncertainty which will enable the UK to plan and finance nuclear energy infrastructure in the long term. However, building confidence in technology and equipment will be key for the UK Government in delivering new nuclear power generation. The perception of nuclear technology by both investors and the general public is largely based on well-known and highly publicised international events – most notably, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the more recent 2011 accident in Fukushima. Both of these incidents were preventable, had international best practice and standards been observed. In the past 10 years, however, there has been a slow but positive shift in the perception of nuclear energy by the UK public. In 2012, only 9% strongly supported the technology and 29% supported its use for electricity generation. According to Statista, this increased to 18% strongly supporting and 24% supporting by 2022 and, those opposing or strongly opposing, dropping from 27% in 2012 to 13% in 2022. The recent energy crisis has further driven positive sentiment toward the technology. A 2023 survey found a 25% increase in net support for new nuclear power since June 2021, with support growing across every age group and nation across the UK. This shift in perception will be bolstered by the Government’ s classification of nuclear as “ environmentally sustainable ”. This is particularly important when considering the benefits that small modular reactors ( SMRs) could offer the UK’ s electricity network, another focus of the Spring Budget. Smaller-scale power plants offer the potential to leverage modular off-site manufacturing for flexible deployment, but most importantly, they require less water for cooling and can therefore be located further inland than typical nuclear energy facilities. This means that SMRs could be located closer to where the energy demand is higher – reducing the amount of infrastructure required to transfer energy to where it is needed. The UK Government has launched “ Great British Nuclear ” with a mission to identify the best small modular reactor ( SMR) technology for the UK. Whether this will be the Rolls Royce SMR initially proposed at three sites, or one of the other available technologies, there will be a need to ensure that the UK has the manufacturing capability, innovation and skills necessary to capitalise on this opportunity.

394,"Capricorn Energy has conceded that it expects to hold an EGM on February 1 but has warned shareholders against rejecting its proposed combination with NewMed Energy. Palliser Capital is an activist shareholder in Capricorn, agitating for an end to the deal and a faster return of capital. Palliser requisitioned the EGM, where it is calling for shareholders to remove seven Capricorn directors and install six new ones. Capricorn said the Palliser nominees would probably terminate the merger with NewMed and implement the Palliser plan, “ which is likely to destroy value ”. Panmure Gordon’ s Ashley Kelty commented there was a “ genuine risk ” that the board could be ousted. “ Several large shareholders have indicated their displeasure at the terms of the NewMed deal ”, he said. Capricorn has invited the six nominees to sign NDAs and review the business plan and additional details. The candidates would be able then to “ better assess … the strategic alternatives that have previously been explored by the board ”. The company expects to hold a vote on the proposed combination at around the same time as the Palliser EGM. Palliser’ s proposals make a number of mistakes around how it would return cash to shareholders, Capricorn said. Palliser overstates the value of Capricorn’ s receivables, failing to risk them, and the value of the Egyptian assets, ignoring the need for investment. The UK receivable has a fair value of $ 205 million, rather than $ 241mn, because of falling oil prices. The risked value of the Senegal receivable is $ 57mn, down $ 16mn, given the chances of later than expected start up. It also is overly optimistic on licence modernisation on Egypt. The investor has cited a similar move by APA Corp., but failed to account for a $ 100mn signature bonus and a material spending programme.

405,"The challenges to making green hydrogen production commercially viable can be tackled if the right technology and economic infrastructure are in place, writes Maria Anez-Lingerfelt, senior scientist at Pall Corporation. The demand for new green energy strategies is increasing and hydrogen is regarded as a key factor in meeting international emissions targets and achieving net zero by 2050. The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks. In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026. In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production. BP is paying $ 36bn for a 40.5% stake in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, set to be one of the largest green hydrogen and renewable energy hubs in the world. Shell has committed to building a renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands, which will be the largest in Europe once operational in 2025. China National Petroleum Corp has pledged to move 50% of its output to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and clean power by 2050. While Exxon Mobil is planning to build a $ 100bn hydrogen production and carbon capture plant in Texas. The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges. International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify. So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen. Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option. To make green hydrogen commercially viable at scale, there will need to be increased power capacity from wind farms and solar plants and the optimisation of the production process using electrolysers to carry out the chemical process. The electrolysis process involves the dissociation of the water molecule in an electric field. Hydrogen is then produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode with an electrolyte present in between the electrodes. There are three types of electrolysers that can be used. The alkaline electrolyser ( AEL) uses liquid potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and is the most widely used in industrial applications, but comes with some drawbacks, including lower purity levels and lower energy efficiency. Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser ( PEM) uses a solid polymer electrolyte and is increasingly being favoured because it has fewer of these drawbacks but is still expensive compared to AEL. Solid oxide electrolysers ( SOEC) use a solid ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte – a technology that holds great potential but is still in early stages of commercialisation. Whichever electrolysis technology is used, the hydrogen stream needs to be further processed to remove solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants. It is in this process that the real technical challenge lies because the regulations around gas purity specifications are extremely stringent. Typically, concentrations between 2,000-6,000 ppm ( parts per million) of oxygen and more than 2,000 ppm of water are seen contaminating the hydrogen produced using commercial alkaline electrolysis. The maximum concentration allowed for fuel cell vehicles is 5 ppm of each under the ISO standard for hydrogen fuel quality. This gap between outputs and purity standards is why AEL systems – the most widely used in industrial applications – require further optimisation to produce green hydrogen at a large scale. Several unit operations using filtration, separation and purification technology are needed to achieve the required purity levels. Once the hydrolysis has taken place, the liquid/gas mixture needs to be cooled, separated, and compressed. However, cooling the gas has major cost implications and can be as high as 5% of the total system outlay. Gravity separators, mist eliminators pads, filter vane separators and more recently liquid/gas coalescers are used to separate the liquid contaminants. These typically require large housings and must be operated at low velocities to prevent liquid re-entrainment. After removing the liquids, the hydrogen is fed into a catalytic reactor to remove the contaminating oxygen. The catalyst in this step is sensitive to contamination such as potassium hydroxide ( KOH) so the hydrogen entering this step must meet the required purity specifications. To add to the purification costs, solid contaminants, originating from oxidation in process piping and equipment such as pumps and compressors, must be eliminated. Adsorbent fines – if being used – are situated in the final drying equipment and may also get released, contaminating the gas. To remove the solid contaminants, disposable gas filters in different micron ratings can be deployed throughout the process.","What is the global demand for hydrogen, and why is it considered a key factor in meeting international emissions targets?",The global demand for hydrogen is increasing due to the need for new green energy strategies to meet international emissiots ans targend achieve net zero by 2050.

The UK government has ambitions to double production of hydrogen to 10GW by 2030, and the US’ Department of Energy has announced plans to fund a $ 8bn programme of regional clean hydrogen hubs to connect producers and consumers with infrastructural frameworks. In the EU, the REPowerEU plan sets out a vision for the bloc to produce 10 million tonnes and import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030 – nearly double the figures from the 2021 revised Renewable Energy Directive. While in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants his country to be the world’ s biggest exporter of hydrogen when a new plant opens at the Neom city project in 2026. In industry, oil and gas giants are also ramping up investment in green energy production.

The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and low carbon power generation is progressing, but there are challenges. International classification society DNV has produced its first standalone hydrogen forecast, saying that hydrogen is likely to account for 11% of Europe’ s energy mix by 2050, but only 5% globally. It states that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient to produce, compared to direct electrification, but notes that its use will be vital for aviation, shipping and high-heat industrial processes which are difficult to electrify. So, what are the options? Of the different ‘ colours’ of the gas, grey and brown hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide, which needs to be captured and stored to reduce its polluting effects on the environment. If a carbon capture step is added, then it will be termed blue hydrogen. Green hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources; it does not produce CO2 and so is the ‘ cleanest’ option.

425,"Carbon capture and storage ( CCS) has long been touted as part of the solution to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Fast forward to 2023 and global policy experts increasingly identify CCS as an essential part of the global path to maintaining the Paris Agreement’ s target of limiting global temperate rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. One of the persistent arguments against the use of CCS is that it will prolong the transition away from the use of fossil fuels and thereby prolong the ‘ fossil fuel age’. Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation. Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement. Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good. Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline. The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited. The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas. Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced. Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees. While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.

428,"Carbon capture and storage ( CCS) has long been touted as part of the solution to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Fast forward to 2023 and global policy experts increasingly identify CCS as an essential part of the global path to maintaining the Paris Agreement’ s target of limiting global temperate rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. One of the persistent arguments against the use of CCS is that it will prolong the transition away from the use of fossil fuels and thereby prolong the ‘ fossil fuel age’. Historically, the majority of CCS facilities under development or in operation were attached to natural gas processing or fossil fuel-fired power generation. Today, the development of CCS projects is expanding beyond the fossil fuel sector, moving into other hard-to-decarbonise industries, such as cement, pulp and paper. However, CCS is still seen – erroneously – as taking resources and focus away from carbon abatement. Canada’ s pulp and paper sector is a prime example of how this opposition may be doing more harm than good. Since the 1990s, pulp and paper mills across Canada have aggressively worked to reduce their GHG emissions by moving away from high-intensity fossil fuels to natural gas and, in many cases, bioenergy produced from wood waste. By 2020, Canada’ s pulp and paper sector had reduced its GHG emissions by 60% from a 1990 baseline. The options for making further emissions reductions in the short- to medium-term in Canada’ s pulp and paper sector are limited. The continued use of natural gas at pulp and paper mills is generally required to operate boilers or other equipment, which requires a reliable and secure source of energy. In most locations there is no viable alternative to natural gas. Replacing existing boilers with more energy efficient boilers comes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per boiler, with most facilities operating multiple boilers. The technology has yet to be developed to reduce the energy intensity of the drying process without negatively impacting the quality of pulp and paper produced. Moreover, at least some of the carbon reduction success achieved by Canada’ s pulp and paper sector relies on the carbon neutrality assumption associated with combusting wood waste. In other words, the carbon that is emitted from the combustion of wood waste is assumed to be zero, based on the lifecycle carbon assessment of trees. While these carbon neutral emissions are technically moving the sector towards net zero, there is ongoing debate over the validity of the carbon neutrality assumption. The gains that Canada’ s pulp and paper sector has achieved looks less impressive if the carbon neutrality assumption no longer holds.

517,"Cruise has slowly been expanding its network of robotaxis and their availability in certain markets. Though, it’ s been a long time since the company entered new cities … until now. Cruise is now coming to Houston and Dallas. While Cruise vehicles will be fully self driving and operate even without safety drivers in other markets, for some period of time, they will include safety drivers in Dallas and Houston. If you’ re in one of the cities where Cruise operates — San Francisco, Austin, Dallas, Houston, or Phoenix — you can try to start using Cruise robotaxis by getting on the company’ s waitlist. It’ s not open to everyone yet. We’ ll start supervised driving in Houston in the coming days, with Dallas to follow shortly thereafter. Be sure to join our waitlist to be amongst the first to experience driverless rides: https: //t.co/0d4QmeyRiV Cruise’ s progress has been a bit of a “ two steps forward, one step backward ” situation. Back in June of 2022, Cruise became the first robotaxi company to offer autonomous rides for a fare ( not just for free), but a month later, it was making headlines for clogging up streets in San Francisco. Toward the end of 2022, Cruise expanded massively in the San Francisco region. In December, Cruise launched in Austin, Texas. ( I actually snapped the pics of Cruise vehicles in Austin, above and below, in November as they were getting settled there.) That was two steps forward, so we must be at one step back next, right? Indeed. “ In January, San Francisco’ s Transportation Authority asked regulators to limit or temporarily pause Cruise and competitor Waymo’ s expansion, citing repeated cases of their cars inexplicably stopping in traffic and blocking emergency vehicles, ” Engadget reports. But that’ s no reason to stop the fun train. “ As of yet, things have done anything but slow down. Since the request, Cruise celebrated one million fully driverless miles on top of making its robotaxis available at all times in San Francisco — though full access is only for employees. ” Unfortunately, you can’ t just grab a Cruise robotaxi in Houston and Dallas now. What we know is that it’ s entering these markets, not when. In case you haven’ t been following along, Cruise robotaxis are considered Level 4 autonomous. They can operate 100% on their own within certain geographic boundaries or parameters. You can’ t drop them in the desert and ask them to get you to the nearest Starbucks. ( Well, I guess Phoenix is sort of the desert … but anyway.) One thing that crossed my mind while uploading these pictures is that these robotaxis have been based on an electric car model that is being discontinued, the Chevy Bolt. What will Cruise turn to next? One possibility is the Cruise Origin, a robotaxi-tailored vehicle that’ s been in development for years, first unveiled in January 2020. Aside from delivering humans to their desired destinations, Cruise is inching into the actual delivery business as well. “ Cruise is also working on expansion of its autonomous vehicles into delivery services, ” GM Authority writes. “ Autonomous vehicle units equipped with a locker to securely carry groceries or other delivery payloads have been reported. Major retail chain Walmart is investing in the technology, with eight stores currently participating in testing. ” What’ s next in Cruise news? We’ ll see, and we’ ll let you know. Cruise aims to earn $ 1 billion in annual revenue by 2025. Can it do that? On the technical side of things, you can explore Cruise’ s April 2023 release notes here.

In the latest development, BMW is working with the leading California utility, PG & E, to demonstrate how EV batteries can contribute to grid stability instead of placing new burdens on the nation’ s electricity infrastructure. The secret sauce is V2X, the Vehicle-to-Everything model for using an EV battery to power all sorts of electric devices. BMW is kicking vehicle-to-everything ( V2X) into high gear with an assist from the California utility PG & E. Photo courtesy of BMW. The infrastructure argument against widespread EV adoption has been neatly summed up by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who called zero emission vehicles a “ new way to overburden California’ s already collapsing energy grid ” in a segment last September. Whoa if true. However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity. The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs. On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption. V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix. None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates. The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid. The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet. “ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement. The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase. “ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America. As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere. Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too. “ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains. The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy. So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good. “ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported. PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables. In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles. “ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners. PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more. Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner. “ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways. You can generate it with solar, with wind, in a camper, and with hydropower, ” an Army spokesperson said. “ Electricity is going to be the fuel of tomorrow. ” No more Trainwreck Twitter.

In the latest development, BMW is working with the leading California utility, PG & E, to demonstrate how EV batteries can contribute to grid stability instead of placing new burdens on the nation’ s electricity infrastructure. The secret sauce is V2X, the Vehicle-to-Everything model for using an EV battery to power all sorts of electric devices. BMW is kicking vehicle-to-everything ( V2X) into high gear with an assist from the California utility PG & E. Photo courtesy of BMW. The infrastructure argument against widespread EV adoption has been neatly summed up by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who called zero emission vehicles a “ new way to overburden California’ s already collapsing energy grid ” in a segment last September. Whoa if true. However, not true according to professionals who actually know a thing or two about electricity. The leading utility National Grid, for example, does caution that grid issues could arise from a piecemeal approach to fleet electrification, when too many fleets are clustered in one area. Its main point, though, was to advocate for proactive, collaborative planning and infrastructure investment to foster a smooth transition to EVs. On a broader scope, EV stakeholders are already engaged with “ smart charging ” strategies that take advantage of low-demand periods along with the availability of renewable energy. That includes the sprawling ERCOT-managed grid in Texas, which has engaged in a global effort to speed up renewable energy integration in tandem with EV adoption. V2X is a key element in the strategy. Electric vehicles are actually just large batteries on wheels. Like any battery, they can be used to run individual devices or whole electrical systems. Ford is already pitching its F-150 Lightning pickup truck as an emergency backup generator, with solar power in the mix. None of this is particularly new. Back in 2014, the US Air Force engaged a fleet of EVs in a vehicle-to-grid charging system. Around the same time, Ford paired up with KB Home to demonstrate an integrated rooftop solar-plus-storage system that leverages an EV battery to get the most bang out of off-peak electricity rates. The question is how to best deploy V2X power for the good of the whole grid. The grid question is the one that PG & E ( Pacific Gas & Electric) aims to answer, with an assist from BMW of North America. If all goes according to plan, the win-win-win is lower electricity bills for EV owners, improved grid reliability for everyone, and maximal use of renewable energy for the planet. “ The V2X testing is taking place at PG & E’ s Applied Technology Services ( ATS) Lab in San Ramon and is the focal point of an extended partnership to advance V2X technology and explore the utilization of EVs as a flexible grid resource, ” PG & E explained in a press statement. The new program is based on the success of ChargeForward, an earlier smart charging program that PG & E launched with BMW back in 2015 to reward EV drivers for charging up with more renewable energy ( check out more PG & E news here). ChargeForward initially enlisted 100 BMW i3 drivers for an 18-month pilot project and is currently in its third phase. “ V2X takes smart charging to the next level, exploring how EV batteries can be used for backup generation and other grid services, ” explains Adam McNeill, VP of Engineering for BMW of North America. As described by PG & E, the electric vehicle experience of the future will be unlike the current model of car ownership, in which the car spends most of its time sitting in a parking spot twiddling its thumbs until the driver needs to go somewhere. Instead, PG & E envisions EVs going to work for their owners and the grid, too. “ V2X technology will someday empower EV drivers to return excess stored energy from their vehicle batteries back to the grid in exchange for compensation, presenting an ideal response to high-demand power conditions and a key solution for grid stability and resiliency, ” PG & E explains. The virtual power plant model would involve recharging EV batteries during periods when solar or wind availability peaks, enabling the whole grid to absorb more renewable energy. So, will the vision become reality? Some of the results are already in. The new V2X project is a pilot project to assess how the technology can enable a typical California home to use the most renewable energy, and so far, so good. “ Results show that a vehicle-to-home connected EV is capable of providing roughly double the amount of renewable energy that a typical California household would be able to use on an average day, significantly increasing customers’ ability to use more green energy on a daily basis, ” PG & E reported. PG & E noted that the real-world testing also aims to assess how drivers balance their desire to drive with the desire to use more renewables. In the latest development, BMW and PG & E are committed to V2X testing for another two years, until March 2026. The next step will involve a vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) test at the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View. BMW is also going to develop its own fleet of V2X vehicles. “ This field test will evaluate how V2X technology can be used for advanced use cases that can be commercialized in future years and help support renewable integration on a neighborhood level to increase grid reliability on a larger scale, ” PG & E stated, which indicates that the utility has its eye on fleet electrification beyond individual BMW owners. PG & E is looking at the grid-wide implications of V2X, but individual EV owners don’ t have to wait for the results of its assessment to roll in. Ford, for example, is already marketing its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck as a rolling powerhouse for emergency backup generation, and more. Meanwhile, the combo of renewable energy and EV charging is surfacing in some interesting places. The US Army was so eager to get its hands on the F-150 Lightning that it ordered a fleet of 25 even before the Army had EV chargers to charge them up. Further, solar power will be in play when it comes to providing those electric pickup trucks with their juice. Fort Carson plans to install six new solar-powered charging stations within the next few weeks, each with two charging ports, so the fleet should be ready to roll in short order. Another five charging stations are also in the works. Additional charging stations will probably be on the way to help accommodate plans for rolling over the Army’ s entire fleet of non-tactical vehicles into EVs by 2027, which is just around the corner. “ The benefit of electricity is you can generate it in so many ways. You can generate it with solar, with wind, in a camper, and with hydropower, ” an Army spokesperson said. “ Electricity is going to be the fuel of tomorrow. ” No more Trainwreck Twitter.

580,"Volkswagen Group’ s electric transition is continuing at a good pace. Its pure electric ( BEV) sales were up nearly 50% in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2022. They grew from 217,200 to 321,600. Furthermore, there are another 200,000 or so BEV orders on the books just in Western Europe. Reaching 321,600 deliveries in the first half of the year, that was 7.4% of Volkswagen Group’ s overall vehicle deliveries. That’ s an increase from the company’ s 5.6% figure for the first half of 2022. While Tesla is known to be the world leader in BEV sales ( and # 2 behind BYD in plugin vehicle sales), Volkswagen Group is actually # 1 in BEV sales in Europe. Furthermore, the company’ s sales growth in Europe even surpassed its sales growth worldwide. Sales grew from 128,900 in the first half of 2022 to 217,100 in the first half of 2023, which is 68% growth ( compared to 50% growth worldwide). Additionally, the recent trend and expected trend going forward is even stronger than at the beginning of the year. “ With an increase in all-electric deliveries of around 50 percent in the first half of the year, the Volkswagen Group is systematically continuing its transformation, ” Hildegard Wortmann, member of Volkswagen Group’ s Extended Executive Committee for Sales, says. “ Since May, we have again seen an improved trend in incoming orders here, after a certain reluctance on the part of our customers at the start of the year due to reduced subsidy programs, partly long waiting times and high inflation. In view of the recent significant reduction in delivery times, we expect this positive trend to continue in the coming months. ” The USA is coming through with big growth as well. Volkswagen Group reached 29,800 sales there, a 79% increase over the previous year. However, there’ s one stain on the company’ s jacket. Deliveries were 2% lower in China, totaling 62,400. But Volkswagen Group brought out some positive news from there nonetheless — it did see 18% growth in BEV sales in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. So, we can say that the numbers are still rising fast there. Looking at the second quarter more broadly — worldwide — deliveries were up 53%, from 118,000 in the second quarter of 2022 to 180,600 in the second quarter of 2023. Volkswagen Group’ s BEV sales are dominated by sales in Europe, and then almost all of the rest of sales are in China and the USA. Europe accounts for 68% of sales, China 19%, and the USA 9%. That leaves 4% for the result of the world. What about the brand split? There are approximately 100 auto brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella, right? ( Maybe not 100.) Volkswagen accounted for a little more than half of the auto group’ s BEV sales ( 164,800 vehicles), Audi accounted for 24% ( 75,600 vehicles), ŠKODA accounted for 10% ( 31,300 vehicles), SEAT/CUPRA accounted for 6% ( 18,900 vehicles), Porsche accounted for 6% ( 18,900 vehicles), and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles accounted for 4% ( 12,300 vehicles).

Sales grew from 128,900 in the first half of 2022 to 217,100 in the first half of 2023, which is 68% growth ( compared to 50% growth worldwide). Additionally, the recent trend and expected trend going forward is even stronger than at the beginning of the year. “ With an increase in all-electric deliveries of around 50 percent in the first half of the year, the Volkswagen Group is systematically continuing its transformation, ” Hildegard Wortmann, member of Volkswagen Group’ s Extended Executive Committee for Sales, says. “ Since May, we have again seen an improved trend in incoming orders here, after a certain reluctance on the part of our customers at the start of the year due to reduced subsidy programs, partly long waiting times and high inflation. In view of the recent significant reduction in delivery times, we expect this positive trend to continue in the coming months. ” The USA is coming through with big growth as well. Volkswagen Group reached 29,800 sales there, a 79% increase over the previous year. However, there’ s one stain on the company’ s jacket. Deliveries were 2% lower in China, totaling 62,400. But Volkswagen Group brought out some positive news from there nonetheless — it did see 18% growth in BEV sales in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. So, we can say that the numbers are still rising fast there. Looking at the second quarter more broadly — worldwide — deliveries were up 53%, from 118,000 in the second quarter of 2022 to 180,600 in the second quarter of 2023. Volkswagen Group’ s BEV sales are dominated by sales in Europe, and then almost all of the rest of sales are in China and the USA. Europe accounts for 68% of sales, China 19%, and the USA 9%. That leaves 4% for the result of the world. What about the brand split? There are approximately 100 auto brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella, right? ( Maybe not 100.) Volkswagen accounted for a little more than half of the auto group’ s BEV sales ( 164,800 vehicles), Audi accounted for 24% ( 75,600 vehicles), ŠKODA accounted for 10% ( 31,300 vehicles), SEAT/CUPRA accounted for 6% ( 18,900 vehicles), Porsche accounted for 6% ( 18,900 vehicles), and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles accounted for 4% ( 12,300 vehicles).

595,"More EV battery activity is stirring over at the Hell’ s Kitchen geothermal brine lithium supply project. The race to supply the global auto industry with enough lithium to fuel the switchover from gas to lithium-ion EV batteries is churning into high gear. The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project. Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California. The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain. That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot. “ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed. The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ” The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit. On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances. In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem. “ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website. The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed. The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply. Specifically, CTR estimates that it could recover five times the amount of manganese than lithium from its geothermal brine. The company anticipates it can achieve those results without crimping its lithium production timeline. They expect to conduct tests on “ live ” brine sometime this year to explore the subject further. Stellantis, for one, has spotted an opportunity. On August 17 the company announced a $ 100 million-plus investment to help grow the lithium supply project. Forget the initial projection of 20,000 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate per year. As described by Stellantis, Hell’ s Kitchen is “ the world’ s largest geothermal lithium project with a total resource capacity to produce up to 300,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent. ” “ Additionally, the companies expanded the initial supply agreement, which now calls for CTR to supply up to 65,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate ( LHM) each year over a 10-year contract term, ” Stellantis notes. “ This new agreement incorporates the original lithium supply agreement signed by both companies in June 2022 for up to 25,000 metric tons of LHM per year. ” If all goes according to plan, Hell’ s Kitchen will begin producing LHM for Stellantis in 2027. The plan could also involve General Motors, which reportedly put up some big bucks back in 2021 to nail down first dibs on the Hells’ Kitchen lithium supply — unless they dropped the idea somewhere along the way. CleanTechnica is reaching out to CRT for an update on that. The environmental and human rights issues bedeviling the global lithium supply chain have been well documented, including impacts related to energy consumption, water resources, open pit mining and evaporation lagoons. The US has a chance to get it right, mainly because very little lithium mining is taking place here at the present time. The only lithium mine currently operating in the US is the Silver Peak mine in Nevada, which dates back to the 1960s. Now the pressure is on to increase the domestic supply of lithium to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles, and conflicts are already arising. One example is the new Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, where work is under way despite furious pushback from local tribes and ranchers as well as environmentalists. NASA has also weighed in on the Biden administration’ s plans to lease federal lands to boost the domestic lithium supply chain. “ An ancient Nevada lakebed beckons as a vast source of the coveted element needed to produce cleaner electric energy and fight global warming, ” the Associated Press reported in June. “ But NASA says the same site — flat as a tabletop and undisturbed like none other in the Western Hemisphere — is indispensable for calibrating the razor-sharp measurements of hundreds of satellites orbiting overhead. ” Geothermal brine projects can also involve land use conflicts, but not to the same extent involved in open pit mining. Though plans to co-locate other facilities at the Hell’ s Kitchen campus will expand its footprint considerably, the geothermal power plant and lithium supply operation only takes up about 50 acres. In contrast, the Silver Peak lithium mine spans 13,000 acres. The Thacker Pass project involves 6,000 acres of mining activity over a parcel of public land spanning nine square miles, and a proposed lithium mine in North Carolina will include four open pits covering 1,500 acres. In addition, the Hell’ s Kitchen system is designed to run on renewable energy without the need for evaporation lagoons. The spent brine is returned underground. Recovering lithium from spent EV batteries could also help alleviate some of these issues. Among other recent battery recycling moves, last fall GM put up a stake in Series A financing for the recycling firm Lithion. Stellantis has also firmed up its end-of-life strategy under a joint venture with Galloo, announced in June. Follow me tinamcasey on Bluesky, Threads, Post, LinkedIn, and Spoutible.

The race to supply the global auto industry with enough lithium to fuel the switchover from gas to lithium-ion EV batteries is churning into high gear. The environmental costs could also be high unless the lithium supply chain focuses on lower-impact extraction technologies. Pressure from automakers would help steer lithium stakeholders in a more sustainable direction, and Stellantis has just upped the ante with a $ 100 million investment in the Hell’ s Kitchen lithium project. Hell’ s Kitchen is the rather poetic name for a geothermal brine project located at the Salton Sea in California. The project came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2021, after we noticed that the US Department of Energy has been eyeballing geothermal brine extraction as a way to stimulate the US geothermal industry while pumping up the nation’ s domestic lithium supply chain. That’ s more complicated than it may seem. Geothermal brine has been described as a “ rich stew ” of dissolved materials, of which lithium is only one. The challenge is to develop an economical way to separate lithium from a stew that is not only rich but also hot. “ To visualize how complex and delicate the extraction process is, imagine you are flipping for baseball cards, except all of your cards are stuck together and they are on fire, ” we observed. The company Controlled Thermal Resources ( CTR) is the developer behind the Hell’ s Kitchen project. The project launched in the fall of 2021 with a relatively modest footprint and was billed as “ the world’ s first, fully integrated, new geothermal-lithium facility to commence construction. ” The Salton Sea already hosted 450 megawatts’ worth of geothermal energy generation by 2021. Initial plans for the Hell’ s Kitchen plant included another 50 megawatts at temperatures ranging from 550–650 degrees Fahrenheit. On the production side, CTR anticipated about metric 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year, along with the potential to produce potassium, zinc, and other substances. In the two years since then, CTR’ s lithium supply project has transformed into a soup-to-nuts EV battery ecosystem. “ We are not just ‘ suppliers of lithium’. We are working with our strategic partners to deliver solutions that support the emerging battery supply chain, ” CTR noted in a Q3 update on its website. The update describes two main projects at the site. One involves the potential to co-locate a cathode active materials facility at the Hell’ s Kitchen site. “ We know this removes shipping risks and costs, lowers C02 emissions, and removes substantial CAPEX and OPEX from bagging, logistics, and de-bagging operations, ” CTR observed. The other project carries forward the idea of separating other materials from geothermal brine in addition to boosting the lithium supply.

615,"The planned offshore wind project in the Gulf of Mexico got off to a slow start after bidders decided to sit out a BOEM auction. It was supposed to be a blockbuster new step forward for offshore wind in the US. Earlier this year, the federal government announced three new zones in the Gulf of Mexico would be opened to offshore wind development — two off the coast of Texas and one off the coast of Louisiana. Sites within the three areas were to be auctioned to the highest bidder in late August. Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans. On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration. The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters. Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ” The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm. Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap. And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ” While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian. Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries. Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ” The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ” Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf. As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry. Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation. To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon. Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan. Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid. Will offshore wind come to the Gulf in the future? “ We’ ll see, ” said the Zen master.

Billions of dollars in federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act were available to the successful bidders. Expectations ran high that offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico would transform the electricity markets in Texas, Louisiana, and other nearby states by making inexpensive renewable energy available to millions of Americans. On August 29, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held the much anticipated auction. When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, no bids were received for the two offshore wind zones near Texas and a total of two bids were received for the zone near Louisiana. According to Reuters, Germany’ s RWE won the rights to 102,480 acres ( 41,472 hectares) off Louisiana, which was the lowest winning bid for a federal offshore wind lease at auction since the Obama administration. The Biden administration wants the US to develop 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Interior Department said the three offered Gulf leases combined had the potential to account for more than 10% of that amount. “ It is striking just how bad the economics clearly must be in order for two of the three sites to remain unsold … and for the site that was sold to go for such a low price, ” Alon Carmel, a partner at PA Consulting, which advises offshore wind companies, told Reuters. Officials and offshore wind advocates were stunned, and pretty soon the postmortem analyses began. What went wrong? There is a laundry list of reasons for the failed auction, according to industry sources, some of whom now say they knew wind farms in the Gulf of Mexico were a bad idea all along. “ The business case in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind is very vague, and very uncertain, ” Chelsea Jean-Michel, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF, told HeatMap recently. “ It doesn’ t really make a lot of sense. ” The Gulf of Mexico has some circumstances that require specialized wind turbines. Wind speeds most of the time are lower than along the Atlantic coast, which means taller structures are necessary. But then, every once in a while, wind speeds are excessive when hurricanes hit the area. In an interesting coincidence, the BOEM auction fell on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Hurricane Idalia is currently working its way up the west coast of Florida and threatening to become a Category 4 storm. Engineers need to design turbines that can harvest enough wind to be profitable yet are able to withstand high winds, something they refer to as “ a challenging design optimization problem. ” For that, a new class of turbines will be needed. While offshore wind turbines have been installed in typhoon-prone areas in Asia, the challenge will be building a supply chain for turbines with bigger rotors and figuring out how intense future hurricanes could be in order to design blades that are strong enough, according to HeatMap. And yet, the Gulf of Mexico does have some advantages. For one, the average depth of the water is quite shallow compared to most areas along the Atlantic coast. For another, the area has a wealth of experience building and installing oil and gas rigs in the area. In fact, Justin Williams of the National Ocean Industries Association told HeatMap that Gulf Coast companies have already brought their expertise to offshore wind construction in the Northeast. “ Take the Block Island Wind Farm offshore Rhode Island, ” he said. “ Gulf Island Fabrication built the steel jackets for its foundations and Montco Offshore provided heavy lift vessels to move the equipment on site. ” While BOEM did include provisions for worker training programs in its bidding package, critics say many other aspects that could promote environmental justice for local residents were left out. Many BOEM projects encourage the use of project labor agreements that establish wages, safety protections, and benefits for workers before hiring begins. “ BOEM recognizes the importance of making sure that we do this economic development in a way where the benefits are going to be spread among a lot of different people, ” Rick Levy, the president of the Texas AFL-CIO, told The Guardian. Despite pressure from unions and climate activists, BOEM stopped short of requiring such agreements, which means there is no guarantee jobs in offshore wind will pay well or will be safe. Texas, which recently passed legislation prohibiting cities from requiring water breaks for outdoor workers, is the only US state that does not require workers’ compensation for on-the-job injuries. Jobs in the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously dangerous, Milliken Biven, formerly of BOEM, told The Guardian. “ There really is no offshore safety program in the Gulf of Mexico. Federal regulators don’ t really have one. If you want to make offshore wind jobs safe, you have to make all offshore jobs safe. We’ re a long way off. ” The Biden administration excluded offshore wind from its hallmark environmental justice plan, Justice40, which is intended to steer 40% of federal environmental investments to vulnerable communities. As part of the 2022 offshore wind lease sale in California, BOEM offered bidding credits for developers who entered into community benefits agreements, but did away with those requirements for the Gulf of Mexico auction. “ The Gulf south has had so much environmental injustice for so long, so much economic justice, so much racism, so much pollution, ” Dix said. “ Yet they removed the community benefit provision. ” Texas and Louisiana are both cool to renewable energy initiatives, despite the fact that Texas has benefited greatly during the long hot summer of 2023 from wind and solar production coupled with energy storage, and Louisiana is currently experiencing massive wildfires. Neither state welcomed the influx of new renewable energy from the Gulf. As a result, several of the companies that qualified for this week’ s auction sale said they would use their leases to power renewable hydrogen installations, an approach climate justice advocates criticize as inefficient and a way to prolong the life of the fossil fuel sector industry. Dix said that for decades, regulators have let energy companies leave their abandoned pipelines in the water. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico is home to more than 18,000 miles of abandoned pipelines, which make it unsafe to place new offshore wind transmission cables nearby without costly remediation. To ensure Gulf communities truly benefit from offshore wind, Dix said, the government must force companies to remove unused infrastructure. It must also stop permitting new oil and gas operations in the region — neither of which is likely to happen any time soon. Offshore wind seems like such a sure bet. Turbines are out of sight of land. No farmland gets sacrificed for renewable energy. The wind blows 24 hours a day. And yet, offshore wind projects are getting cancelled or dialed back as higher interest rates and the rising cost of steel affect profit and loss calculations. The Biden administration is being criticized for promising “ good paying jobs, ” but then not including policy provisions that would make that promise a reality in projects like the Gulf of Mexico wind turbine plan. Clearly there are a myriad of special considerations about putting wind turbines in the Gulf of Mexico that convinced most of the potential bidders to sit on their hands when it came time to bid. Will offshore wind come to the Gulf in the future? “ We’ ll see, ” said the Zen master.

631,"With all of the EV news coming out of the United States, Canada, China, and Europe, sometimes it’ s easy to forget about some of our neighbors to the south. But that’ s a mistake. Many upcoming EVs for the U.S. market are being built in Mexico, and they need the benefits of electric drive down there just as much as we do. But, for my family down there, it’ s probably going to be a long time before I see them come visit in an EV, both because they’ re difficult to afford and because charging is hard to come by. The same would be true if I wanted to take my Bolt to to visit the little town where my grandmother grew up. Safety issues aside, making the 400-mile round trip isn’ t really feasible, because the whole area is a giant charging dead zone. This is a real shame, because it’ s just a 3–4 hour trip into a neighboring state, and it wouldn’ t be a problem if the states were both on this side of the border. Seeing yet another barrier grow between us all isn’ t great. That’ s why I thought it was great news when a press release came across the desk about a deal to install thousands of charging stations in Mexico. Volvo Cars has partnered with Evergo, a leading charging station platform for electric vehicles in the region, as part of its electrification strategy. This alliance aims to accelerate the connectivity of cities and provide Volvo customers in Mexico and Latin America with access to an extensive network of AC and DC chargers. “ Each of the actions we implement are firm steps that help us connect cities. We not only want to promote our objectives, we begin to make them a reality by offering an infrastructure solution that allows the mobility of users who have opted for an electric car, ” said Raymundo Cavazos, general director of Volvo Car México. More importantly, it’ s no small deal. The collaboration aims to install 2,295 chargers in Mexico over the next 3 years, including 803 DC fast charging stations ( which the press release refers to as “ superchargers ”). The companies say this expansion will enhance range freedom for users by providing greater charging access along major routes, but they did not provide further specifics about locations. But, they did share that 2,213 kilometers of tourist routes will soon connect more parts of the country. Chargers are already installed in the Puebla-San Luis Potosí Corridor, and by the end of 2024, new routes like Mexico City-Acapulco, Guadalajara-Puerto Vallarta, Tijuana-Ensenada, Mérida-Cancún, and Monterrey-McAllen will be connected. “ This alliance leads us towards an increasingly promising horizon in terms of electric mobility in Mexico. Through this shared commitment, we ensure that in the short term, a greater number of users can enjoy the benefits of more sustainable mobility, backed by the most advanced technology on the market, and with the necessary confidence to reach the main destinations. of the country without worrying about running out of charge, ” said Daniel López, commercial director of Evergo Mexico. The Evergo and Volvo alliance also extends to Latin America, enabling Volvo users in multiple countries to access the charging network available in Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. The Swedish company also collaborates with VEMO, a cleantech company that integrates the entire clean mobility ecosystem. Together, they have agreed on the installation of 70 chargers in shopping centers and universities. “ By 2025 we have a commitment that half of Volvo vehicles will be fully electric. Our mission is to take care of people, future generations and the environment, electrification plays an essential role in achieving this goal, ” added Raymundo Cavazos, CEO of Volvo Car Mexico. Since launching the Volvo XC40 Recharge in 2021, Volvo has provided a charger to each of its electric vehicle customers, resulting in around 800 home charging network chargers across Latin America as well. Finally, the companies said that starting next year, Volvo electric vehicles will be equipped with the NACS-type connector in Mexico just as they will in the United States and Canada, enabling brand users to utilize Tesla’ s chargers across North America. In Mexico, there will be a total of 660 chargers available, including 60 Superchargers, allowing for even more expansion of charging opportunities for Volvo customers. Considering that there are only 60 Supercharger stations in Mexico and a few dozen CCS or CHAdeMO stations, the deal Volvo and Evergo announced will make a big impact. But, at the same time, it’ s not cause for complacency. Economic trade beyond just tourism to the most popular destinations needs to be a priority. And economic trade isn’ t all semi-trucks and big maquiladora plants along the border, either. There are so, so many small businesses and family businesses that depend on going back and forth across the border in smaller vehicles, too. In other words, Mexico is a much more important trading partner than many people realize, in terms of both current reality and in the potential that exists. To watch the United States and Canada embark on a big move to a different model for fueling our transportation systems is great, but we risk losing circulation to our feet and losing them if we don’ t make sure all of our neighbors are making the journey with us. And don’ t take that as any insult to Mexico, because as anybody who lost their feet can tell you, they’ re something you can’ t easily live without. For this reason, we should encourage more automotive manufacturers to expand their charging presence along highways in Mexico. We should also encourage the U.S. and Canadian governments to pitch in and expand charging opportunities the same way they have been doing in their own countries. To many people, the language and cultural barriers may seem insurmountable, and Mexico might seem like some far-off and exotic place, but to many of us, it’ s both family and an essential trading partner. Leaving it behind would be a mistake of epic proportions. Featured image provided by Volvo Mexico and Evergo. Jennifer Sensiba is a long time efficient vehicle enthusiast, writer, and photographer.

649,"Germany’ s Bundesnetzagentur ( BNetzA or Federal Network Agency) recently unveiled the outcomes of its largest-ever offshore wind auction, awarding 7 GW of new capacity. This significant achievement marks a substantial milestone in Germany’ s quest for renewable energy expansion and is worth about €12.6 billion or $ 13.96 billion. At the Global Wind Energy Summit in Australia last month, offshore wind experts discussed the landmark auction started in April and completed in the middle of July with cautious excitement. Two of Europe’ s big oil companies, BP and Total Energies, won the bids in the North Sea totaling 6 GW and 1 GW in the Baltic Sea. This September, renewed interest in the German auction came about because of the failure of the UK to secure takers for its own offshore wind projects. But the win of BP and Total was seen differently and the impact of the negative bidding required project developers to essentially pay for the privilege of building their wind farms. While it undoubtedly ensured a cost-effective outcome for the government, the repercussions are far-reaching. As an example, wind energy expert Ørsted chose to exit the German seabed lease auction before its completion this September, a Reuters report said last July. The report also indicated that company executives “ expressed concerns about high prices. ” The negative bidding system inherently transfers additional costs to offshore wind developers, who must now decide where to allocate these expenses. The wind supply chain, which is already grappling with inflation and surging input costs, may find itself further burdened. Alternatively, consumers, who are already contending with rising electricity prices and the overall cost of living, may bear the brunt of this financial burden. The Bundesnetzagentur is steadfast in its model to achieve its ambitious energy targets. The outcome of this auction compels offshore wind developers to foot the staggering €12.6 billion bill to the German Government. Notably, 90% of these funds will be allocated to financing grid connection costs, while 5% will be devoted to protecting maritime biodiversity, and another 5% will support environmentally-friendly fishing initiatives. The European Union is committed to enhancing energy security through domestically-sourced renewables, including wind energy. However, Germany’ s negative bidding model in offshore wind energy auctions could undermine these efforts. Negative bidding allows developers to offer to pay the government to build offshore wind farms. This can lead to lower electricity prices for consumers, but it can also put downward pressure on profit margins for companies along the wind energy supply chain. This could discourage investment in new wind energy projects and make it more difficult to achieve the EU’ s renewable energy goals. The German government is urged to reconsider the use of negative bidding in offshore wind energy auctions. Instead, the government should focus on supporting the development of the wind energy supply chain through investments in industrial capacity and infrastructure. Germany plans to tender another 1.8 GW of offshore wind capacity before the end of this year or early 2024 using a different auction design that incorporates a non-price criteria. This is a welcome development according to wind energy experts, as it could help to reduce the unwanted impact of negative bidding on the wind energy supply chain. Klaus Mueller, President of the Federal Network Agency, hailed these zero-cent bids as a positive sign for Germany’ s energy transition, indicating that offshore wind energy is economically viable without subsidies.

676,"It may not be the biggest EV news of the month, but it’ s got to be one of the strongest symbols of the EV transition. One of the most iconic brands in the century-long optimization of automobile engines for sporty driving, with its own tagline being “ The Ultimate Driving Machine, ” BMW has ended the production of combustion engines in its home country of Germany. Germany is one of the leading auto production nations in the world. Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve. Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share. “ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports. That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead. Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020. ( It seems the transition could have been completed sooner.) Also, the German phaseout was planned for earlier this year but got delayed. “ The 1,200 employees who previously worked in engine construction will now be retrained and deployed in other areas in future — either at the Munich plant or at other BMW locations. The Works Council expressly welcomed the decision and multi-million euro investment in 2020 and spoke of a ‘ role model for a successfully organised transformation in German industry. ' ” Without a doubt, as Luke Tonachel of the NRDC just reported in relation to the US and the UAW’ s recent strike, auto industry union workers can see the writing on the wall and don’ t want to be left out of the EV transition. Because if they are, they could be left out in the cold altogether. BMW produces the i4, i5, i7, and iX in Germany. By 2030, one has to think the idea of BMW producing engines in Germany will feel like ancient history, and the company will be manufacturing several more electric vehicle models as well as EV batteries within its borders. For example, BMW’ s hot new Neue Klasse electric vehicles will be produced in Germany starting in 2026. Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

Overall, the article provides a clear and detailed picture of BMW's decision, making it easily answerable to the question.",4.0,"The question is short and directly targets a significant industry shift, highlighting the implications of the German phaseout of combustion engines on the auto industry. The answer will likely delve into the economic, technological, and environmental impacts on manufacturers and the broader sector as a whole.",3.0,"The question refers to a specific event (the German phaseout of combustion engines) and asks about its impact on the auto industry as a whole, implying a need for additional context to understand the question.

680,"It may not be the biggest EV news of the month, but it’ s got to be one of the strongest symbols of the EV transition. One of the most iconic brands in the century-long optimization of automobile engines for sporty driving, with its own tagline being “ The Ultimate Driving Machine, ” BMW has ended the production of combustion engines in its home country of Germany. Germany is one of the leading auto production nations in the world. Much of its workforce and economy are dependent on the auto industry. It is the home base of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and more. When the electric transition is so deep in Germany that world-leading BMW ends production of fossil-burning engines there, then we know we are rapidly climbing up the new-tech S-curve. Of course, we already know that from our monthly sales reports on the country. In October, 17% of new vehicle sales were pure BEV sales, and 24.5% of new vehicle sales were plugin vehicle sales. And that’ s after a subsidy change that led to a recent drop in EV market share. “ BMW has ended the production of combustion engines at its main plant in Munich. The long-announced step was taken to make room for the production of electric cars at the Bavarian plant, ” electrive reports. That said … BMW has moved engine production to Austria and the UK, so it’ s not like the company has ended that segment of its business just yet. Still, with pressure from unions in Germany to make sure BMW’ s auto workers have jobs in the future, it was clever of the company to get out of the engine production business sooner than later in its home country, and to prioritize EV production there instead. Also, while it’ s a big change symbolically, it was announced 3 years ago, in November 2020. ( It seems the transition could have been completed sooner.) Also, the German phaseout was planned for earlier this year but got delayed. “ The 1,200 employees who previously worked in engine construction will now be retrained and deployed in other areas in future — either at the Munich plant or at other BMW locations. The Works Council expressly welcomed the decision and multi-million euro investment in 2020 and spoke of a ‘ role model for a successfully organised transformation in German industry. ' ” Without a doubt, as Luke Tonachel of the NRDC just reported in relation to the US and the UAW’ s recent strike, auto industry union workers can see the writing on the wall and don’ t want to be left out of the EV transition. Because if they are, they could be left out in the cold altogether. BMW produces the i4, i5, i7, and iX in Germany. By 2030, one has to think the idea of BMW producing engines in Germany will feel like ancient history, and the company will be manufacturing several more electric vehicle models as well as EV batteries within its borders. For example, BMW’ s hot new Neue Klasse electric vehicles will be produced in Germany starting in 2026. Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

686,"We recently produced several exclusive reports on US electric vehicle sales and overall US auto industry sales trends. Via those reports, you can explore the top automakers or auto brands in terms of their own internal EV share or in terms of their share of the overall EV market, or you can explore growth of the US EV market as a whole, or you can explore trends in auto brand sales broadly, or you can look at trends in EV market share, or you can look at model-by-model EV sales growth. There are a lot of fun ways to cut the pie and see what’ s been going on. One thing that stands out in these reports compared to any others you might find on the internet on any of these topics is that I go back to 2019 to tease out the comparisons and trends over time. However, one thing I’ ve never really done is narrow down and highlight changes in the EV market compared to changes in the ICEV market. ( To be specific, I’ m referring to the fully electric, or BEV, market here.) Since I’ d already collected all of the core data from automakers over the years, plus a little bit of estimating for brands that lag behind the rest in the data they report ( Tesla included), this wasn’ t a huge challenge — it just required creating a few more rows in my Google Sheet and generating a few more charts. However, I had not thought to do it until requested to by “ Cypress ” under a recent article. What a great suggestion! Why didn’ t I think of that? Well, let’ s just get to the charts and numbers. First of all, as we can see, no matter which time period you look at from the past 4 years, EV sales growth crushes internal combustion engine vehicle ( ICEV) sales trends. Comparing 2023 and 2022 totals, EVs saw 47% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw 10% growth. Comparing 2023 and 2021 totals, EVs saw 142% growth while ICEVs ( gas cars) saw a 3% drop in sales. Wait, which powertrain is struggling with its sales trends? Dipping back into the big, horrible year of COVID, EV sales were up 356% in 2023 compared to 2020, while ICEV sales were up just slightly, 1%. Going even further back, looking at the pre-COVID numbers of 2019, we can see that EV sales were up 385% in 2023 compared to 2019, while ICEV sales were down 14%. So, of all the ways we’ ve looked at changes in the EV market and changes in the auto market as a whole, I think these comparisons most clearly highlight that EV sales have been growing strongly year after year, whereas the non-EV market needs to worry about what’ s happening and plan accordingly.

702,"There have been a lot of questions about the Tesla Cybertruck’ s mass-production potential since the truck was first shown, and we’ re clearly in a kind of “ production hell ” period of the Cybertruck ramp-up. Recently, production was paused and a recall issued because of an issue with the accelerator pedal. Nonetheless, Cybertruck production capacity is slowly ramping up. In the Tesla shareholder letter today and then also on the conference call, it was stated that Tesla reached production of 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week a couple of weeks ago. Of course, that just translates to about 52,000 trucks a year, which is far from Tesla’ s target, but they were proud to boast about this new weekly high. “ The Cybertruck ramp continued successfully at Gigafactory Texas, with a sequential cost improvement in Q1.

704,"There have been a lot of questions about the Tesla Cybertruck’ s mass-production potential since the truck was first shown, and we’ re clearly in a kind of “ production hell ” period of the Cybertruck ramp-up. Recently, production was paused and a recall issued because of an issue with the accelerator pedal. Nonetheless, Cybertruck production capacity is slowly ramping up. In the Tesla shareholder letter today and then also on the conference call, it was stated that Tesla reached production of 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week a couple of weeks ago. Of course, that just translates to about 52,000 trucks a year, which is far from Tesla’ s target, but they were proud to boast about this new weekly high. “ The Cybertruck ramp continued successfully at Gigafactory Texas, with a sequential cost improvement in Q1.

715,"Mention electric cars, and some people will go off on a tirade about how there is not enough electricity to charge them all, and if they happened to be charging at the same time, the electrical grid will implode as transmission wires melt and transformers self-destruct in a shower of sparks. There is some truth to those concerns — tens of millions of electric cars are going to need a lot of electrons to keep their batteries charged. But what most people are blissfully unaware of is that data centers and AI are likely to consume half of all the electricity available from renewable energy resources such as solar and wind farms. The grid is under threat, but it’ s not from EVs, according to Wired. There is a new wind farm off the coast of Scotland that is supposed to be able to power 1.3 million homes, but Amazon has just announced it has spoken for more than half of that installation’ s 880 MW output. As the world’ s biggest companies race to build the infrastructure necessary to enable artificial intelligence, even remote Scottish wind farms are becoming indispensable, Wired says. Which raises this question — Is this why the world is building all these renewable energy resources? We were under the impression that electricity would be used to heat and cool our homes and businesses. Do we the people have to foot the bill to build more transmission lines so Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can save every keystroke and data point in their insatiable quest to bring digital advertisers into our personal space to sell us more stuff? Inquiring minds want to know. Data center activity is increasing dramatically in Europe. Recently, Microsoft announced it would invest $ 3.2 billion for data centers in Sweden. Earlier this year, it said it would double its data center footprint in Germany, while also pledging a $ 4.3 billion data center investment for AI infrastructure in France. Amazon announced a network of data centers in the state of Brandenburg as part of a $ 8.5 billion investment in Germany, later dedicating another $ 17.1 billion to Spain. Google said it would spend $ 1.1 billion on its data center in Finland to drive AI growth. Does anyone notice how these numbers sound a lot like the money the automotive industry is investing in the transition to electric transportation? As the tech giants rush to build more data centers, behind the scenes there is panic around how to power them with renewable energy. Microsoft, Meta, and Google all plan to be net zero before 2030, while logistics-heavy Amazon has targeted 2040. In pursuit of that aim, the past decade has seen those companies hoover up renewable energy contracts with wind or solar companies. But all these projects rely on electricity grids, which are buckling under increased demand for clean energy. That’ s forcing the tech giants to think about their energy intensive futures and consider how they might operate their own off-grid power empires, outside the system. “ There is a recognition that as power demand increases, the industry will have to find alternative energy sources, ” says Colm Shorten, senior director of data center strategy at real estate services company JLL. He says that server farms are increasingly looking for “ behind the wire ” power supply, whether that’ s gas or diesel generators or more innovative technology such as green hydrogen. Oh, joy. Big data wants to build more thermal generation capacity so it can power its servers to absorb an endless stream of ones and zeros. Is this progress? Data centers need power for two primary purposes, Wired says. The first is to power the chips that enable computers to run algorithms or power video games. The second is to cool the servers so they don’ t overheat. Initiatives such as using liquid to cool the chips instead of air are expected to make modest energy savings, but forecasters like the International Energy Association still expect the demand for power to run data centers to double by 2026, thanks in part to the demands of artificial intelligence. For the past five years, tech companies have been on an increasingly frenzied shopping spree for renewable energy contracts known as power purchase agreements, which can enable data center operators to reserve power from a wind farm or solar site before the projects have even been built. In Denmark, there are solar farms paid for by Meta. In Norway, there are wind farms bankrolled by Google. As early adopters of these types of deals, tech companies have helped fuel Europe’ s now-thriving PPA market, says Christoph Zipf, spokesperson at WindEurope. This month, Microsoft struck the world’ s biggest renewable energy deal, signing a $ 10 billion contract for clean power across Europe and the US. Yet renewable energy still needs to run through the electricity grid, which is becoming a bottleneck — especially in Europe — as a surge of renewable producers try to connect to supply green electricity to a multitude of sectors. “ We’ re going to run into energy constraints, ” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicted on a podcast in April. At Davos this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also warned that the status quo was not going to be able to provide AI with the power it needed to advance. “ There’ s no way to get there without a breakthrough, ” he said at a Bloomberg event. Grid operators are essentially saying the same thing. Ireland’ s state-owned electricity provider Eirgrid cited grid problems when it imposed an effective moratorium on Dublin data centers two years ago. When the municipality of Amsterdam introduced a similar pause, the Dutch Data Center Association, an industry group, hit back. “ The current grid congestion in North Holland is blocking the growth of the data center sector, ” it said in a statement. In the search for space on the grid, data centers are being pushed into parts of Europe where their arrival is more conspicuous, risking backlash from the smaller communities when they show up. That trend is already visible in Germany, according to Simon Hinterholzer, researcher at Germany’ s Borderstep Institute for Innovation and Sustainability. “ In the past, the large majority of new data centers were being built in Frankfurt, ” he says. “ This has completely changed in the last two or three years. ” He points to a 300 MW data center being built in the small town of Wustermark, as well as Amazon’ s latest investment in Brandenburg, the region bordering Berlin where more than 70 wind turbines were installed last year. This unquenchable thirst for renewable energy has led to more calls for data centers to find ways to survive off-grid. “ The size of AI projects are getting bigger and bigger, reaching up to 1 gigawatt of power, which can not be supplied by the traditional power grids, ” says Ricardo Abad, founder of data center Quark, which is working on a new site with an unnamed partner in Spain that will be able to generate its own power through onsite solar and wind power. These types of projects are technically still connected to the grid — in case they want to offload excess power — but they have the ability to operate independently, he says. The same year Dublin announced restrictions on data centers, Amazon also opened its largest ever onsite solar farm, spanning the roof and car park of its fulfillment center in Seville, Spain. Google’ s head of data center location strategy in Europe has also expressed interest in onsite renewables for its next generation of server farms. Microsoft and Meta denied running any projects that are entirely off-grid, but in Dublin, Microsoft is building a data center alongside its own backup gas power plant, meaning the site can keep running even if the grid operator kicks it off. The quest for clean electricity to feed the voracious needs of data centers is leading to some hitherto unimaginable ideas. “ In the future, technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, renewable energy sources, and energy storage solutions will be crucial in making this possible, ” says Kilian Wagner, an expert in sustainable digital infrastructures at German digital association Bitkom. OpenAI’ s Altman is already an investor in Helion Energy, an American nuclear fusion company that has also agreed to provide Microsoft with 50 megawatts of electricity from its first fusion nuclear plant, once operational. In the US, Microsoft has already been experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, touting them as a form of emission-free power backup. The demand for precious electricity to power data centers so people can play video games and mine cryptocurrencies may be startling to some. When society needs electricity to heat and cool our homes, make green cement and low carbon steel, and charge the batteries in tens of millions of electric cars, diverting resources to what basically are amusements seems completely unnecessary, if not downright silly. The US government has essentially decreed that green hydrogen developers need to supply their own electricity to run their electolyzers. Would a similar policy make sense for data centers? It seems pretty clear ordinary ratepayers are going to be asked to foot the bill to build the transmission infrastructure to operate these gigantic server farms — at least until someone invents chips that consume 90% less electricity. It does seem that there ought to be a hierarchy that prioritizes who gets first dibs on renewable energy, and it’ s hard to imagine that data centers and AI deserve priority in any such allocation strategy.

743,"The new AlixPartners report 2024 Global Automotive Outlook has stimulated quite a lot of thoughts and feedback. Steve Hanley kicked things off with his summary of the findings. Reading through that, I couldn’ t help chiming in by pulling out a couple of key highlights and expounding on them. In between, though, a reader contributed what might be the most interesting comment of all. Writing the comment under Steve’ s article, “ UjiBebek ” contributes the following: During a recent trip to Thailand I noticed a significant number of Chinese EVs on the roads. According to data published recently, EVs sales in the first five months of 2024 increased by 31% to 43k units, while total vehicles sales dropped by 24%, down to 260k units. I discussed this topic with a local friend, and I found interesting the impact EVs are having on the automotive market overall. The availability of cheap imports from China has triggered a generalized reduction in the prices of cars in the Kingdom. New cars prices dropped significantly, with price reductions of up to 20% applied by dealers on the MSRP of some vehicles, especially those which are in direct competition against the Chinese imports. And as a result, Suzuki and Subaru announced their intention to close shop and exit the local market by the end of 2024. But where the decrement is particularly evident, is in the value of used cars. Depreciation of used cars in Thailand has always been limited ( when compared to developed countries such as Japan, Singapore, the USA, etc.), helping customers who wanted to upgrade their daily drive to a more recent vehicle. At present, however, the residual values of used vehicles are usually lower than the outstanding debts owed to the banks. This is forcing customers, who would have otherwise changed their vehicle with a new one, to stick to their current one till the finance contract terminates ( typically 60 or 72 months). And it is severely limiting their options when the time comes to switch to a new vehicle. So, first of all, let’ s take those EV sales figures a step further. 31% sales growth in the midst of a broader 24% drop in sales in the overall auto market is huge. That means EVs rose from about 12.5% to about 16.5% market share. Thailand should soon be at around one out of every five new cars sold being electric, then one out of every four new cars sold being electric, then. … But exponential growth is one thing. Disrupting pricing in the auto market and essentially chasing some companies out of it in the process is something else. Cheap electric cars from China seem to be doing something special in Thailand. I’ m very curious to explore in more detail with local data sources, and even more than that, I’ m curious to see if these kinds of things are happening in other less-talked-about countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas.
